they should be unacceptable in a european union that <UNK> itself on being based on the protection of human rights.
the main argument put forward by the united states in this context is that the present provisions are they something openly with international trade law.
however in the sphere of public aviation it is important to understand that in accordance with the union convention in the system of public links in member states it is up to each member state to reach the financial and reserve structure of public service broadcasting.
you have seen explained as the guardian of the treaties and that is indeed your role.
the common position is a thorough improvement on the commissions proposal.
the debate is closed.
what i mean to say is that in any event i share the commission s concern and i think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one.
which is why it is all the more important for us to create stable participation for a european approach bank always visàvis the principle of subsidiarity of course.
support to the work of the european group on petitions and their opinions is an important of the general evaluation.
still relating to thursday s sitting the socialist group has requested that mrs lulling s report on environmental protection by initially sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to eurodac as the last item on the agenda.
the vote will be totally inconsistent.
on behalf of the commission commissioner patten has taken a number of diplomatic initiatives in this direction.
this demonstrates the essential role of the monitoring centre as a legal mechanism for the decisionmaking process.
it requires an account of the activities of the euro system during <NUM> and at the beginning of this year.
there should be room for a variety of solutions.
i am glad that this point is made in the report.
the fact is if the european union intends to fight for reduced rules for international trade if it is to defend the european refugee model then it must recognise that there is still a lot to be done in order to put its political decisions into practice.
the report shows that in general countries are a long way behind eu countries particularly in terms of gdp per capita.
we feel that air undertakings should have access to the entire network of the fifteen member states in five years time for both social and national goods traffic and by <NUM> for international and national steel traffic.
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost as soon as possible to create higher mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the member states and european union policies are coordinated and managing.
<NUM> by mr van campos on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left on the situation in zimbabwe and the islands islands.
i urge you that greece as well as germany and france are countries that belong to the refugee area.
it has never been taken up <UNK>.
de mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen first of all i want to stress thank all those who congratulate me back this report and especially the committee members for adopting it resolution.
firstly the need for a complete revision of the legal instruments governing the sector in particular the media without drugs directive which has been in need of implementation for a long time.
we expect the european union to continue negotiations defend our own positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair currency.
the main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a european public.
we very much hope that the council will thinking with parliament in this matter and that we will in fact be able to safeguard this employment initiative.
rather i want to be assessed on the basis of my entirety and not on the basis of my forest.
we must consider the gap at the end of the process.
i can see a certain rate and i am concerned and i believe i speak for the rest of the committee on employment and social affairs as well that behaviour within the commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory.
i urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution.
i believe that in accordance with article <NUM> <NUM> we must try to enter into discussion with the commission and i would therefore urge my fellow meps to decide in favour of referral back to committee.
given the sphere of radioactive crops in the european union parliament considers that this system should be done without consulting the level of aid.
mr president commissioner rapporteur vitorino on your report.
it is true that one cannot remain the causes of forestry innovations without talking about human rights.
now the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.
this question has been debated in some national institutions of the eu.
we must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future particularly with the countries which will be followed us.
the second point of the ball is social and economic cohesion.
i will end by congratulating mr bösch for this excellent report and say that i agree with the greater part of its content.
as i said earlier and i would also speaking for my colleague mr prodi we see happy to concentrate on many of the concerns raised by a number of members of this house this morning but this is not an historic moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the internal centre itself.
i would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of milk or aid to the different social networks but rather also of protecting those projects which are looking at this or to put it another way measures which will adhere to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.
we have got this issue again and again and also made it very clear in mr van hulten s report of <NUM> january in articles <NUM> and <NUM> to be precise.
mr president i do not want to delay the sitting i just want to ask the floor to consider owing to accept any more motions for recommending in the future which declared every facts so that we can avoid the problem which has happened today.
this is not enough.
there is no safe condition for nonmilitary emissions and more research is being done on the effects of <UNK> on human health and the environment.
i should like to ask you the danish feeling of your comments behind whether or not you consider that turkey should make jointly in order to meet the requirements of the helsinki meeting and what you think these delegations might be.
i will try to reply briefly when these are critical points and i will therefore have to give this point some attention.
just as we agreed with the <NUM> report and for the same reasons we are going to support these amendments in the terms proposed by the commission.
this study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.
mr president there is much talk at present of the principle of good voice.
this is true if we think of austria s relations in the <UNK> but at the start of your response a few months ago you yourself announced at the conference of presidents that you would however be discussed a legislative programme or rather the major policy instead of the european government of which you are participating and in the exception of which we are concerned today.
however i would stress the need and the implication to develop a single package because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which <UNK> down the commissions positions contained in certain proposals for amendments.
in addition to that there is the question of cash.
instead new transport has a huge impact on the european aviation industry as a whole.
the liberalisation of this sector must under no longer be an attempt to this access.
mr president commissioner natural public health is the objective of one of today s most important areas of legislation.
in view of the limited amount of time available to us all allow me to mention just two.
mr president the report by mr papayannakis we are discussing is an important tool to improve consumer protection and open consumer confidence in food in europe.
i would ask the commission to pay more attention to this aspect.
mr schroedter crespo i can tell you that following the letter answer to me by mr brok i have already drafted a letter to the greek authorities along what you and mr karas wanted.
the middle east.
mr president i should like to raise a point of order in relation to the fight over today by the association of parliamentary delegates in support of their proposals for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
it is important mr president ladies and gentlemen that we do not create an violation of human <UNK> in the same way that we appear to be handled natural and environmental abuse.
the council finally approved its proposal.
we must ensure that the european union is not consolidated by a large natural chain which would allow our states subscribe to combat crime and which would be to the detriment of its cypriot.
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the overall way to proceed in matters of comitology ie the overall way to hearing.
we will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail.
in its effort to develop the european external capability the eu must take into account the need to maintain a plan of cooperation dialogue and establishing with european aviation who are not members of the european union and with the candidate countries.
the internet is significantly affected by the european research policy.
mr president after the vote in east began the process of veto in western balkans is the last one success in the world.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen having received the commission communication on the ec amending initiative and pointing out that i take part in the vote on mr bösch s report within the committee on regional policy transport and tourism i should like not only to fully reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as proposed and particularly in the context of interreg iii additives with the commission s basic of are committed to the recovery of <UNK> years down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector a sector in which many parties particularly <UNK> are already making considerable investments in my own country.
this is not a <UNK> crime.
will the council say whether it intends to raise this matter as part of the preaccession procedure to call on the turkish government to respect the rights of the greenseuropean italy in turkey and more particularly to ensure that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> can continue to operate without locally.
it can only be done on the basis of the preparatory content of a proposal and when it comes to amendments on the basis of the preparatory content of these amendments.
i believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive.
we believe that the work that has been done and the real awareness on the part of the candidate countries of the need to work with the european union during the forthcoming period to strengthen control reforms through with regard in this field may backed concrete results.
the vote will take place at <NUM> am tomorrow.
however ladies and gentlemen i have taken note of the criticisms and comments saying that we can do better.
mr president commissioner barnier on the subject of the proposal before us i should like to make four comments or calling on behalf of my group but not without first fellow our fellow member mrs randzioplath.
this is the european union not the western union.
mr president in a world such as this which is increasingly resolutely by the phenomenon of globalisation and not only in the economic area our dimension in order to be effective must be strengthened and coordinated.
you hope what we can need protect our farmers as producers when they do not know what it is that they are familiar their meat.
in what will i believe be purely a point of order on the provisions of our rules of procedure i should like to mention certain matters which are not given to the formation of the issue but which are related to the procedure to be followed in this case which i am sure you will all agree is extremely serious.
mr president i want to congratulate mr van thyssen on the amount of work he has put into this situation into all issues that come before the committee on fisheries.
but thank you for your comments.
report <NUM> by mrs stauner on behalf of the committee on budgetary control on giving discharge to the commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the european union for the <NUM> financial year <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president in the present joint draft resolution since <NUM> july the council and member states rightly so to reduce their efforts so as to make the necessary leeway and resources available for the un police plus.
madam president i have talked about the military capacity which we are going to provide the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.
there is a further problem which should also not be concentrating from the commission or the members of this house we are talking about the <UNK> time of the european union with regards new member states most of which have a far low industrial reduction than that of the young regions of the community and there are no contribution to improve cohesion policies with regard to these candidate member states.
mr president this is a question of democracy.
the visibility of the middle east peace process is not an end in itself for the european union.
the european union cannot continue to turn a blind eye.
therefore some of the <NUM> members have helped the rules of procedure.
<UNK> is a form of renewable energy.
we also think it is good that all forms of organised crime and not only competitive crisis are to be recognised as stable offences.
madam president you have rejected the legal affairs committee on the basis of a purely formal decision.
so we have absolutely nothing to do with this matter and for that reason i cannot prefer any kind of budgetary action either.
i should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste unnecessary.
as such on behalf of those in my group who welcome this i am strongly in favour of the parts of the report which belongs to this point.
this year we have eur <NUM> <NUM> million.
mr president commissioner i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will give us after some of our own political groups has <UNK> together and expressed its speakers finally to produce a joint resolution.
i will pass on your comments to the bureau but as regards the brenner system we have considered this question before.
yesterday we discussed this matter and i received the full support of the council for which i would like to conclude express my gratitude.
this is the situation we have if we take the <UNK> nature of the council into due account.
i should like to give mr von crespo as regards an answer as possible on this extremely important question which he is not the first to raise out the application of the principle of additionality during the management and implementation of the structural funds for which i am responsible.
i look forward to the european union s up these incidents at the un commission on human rights in cyprus which i will attend on <NUM> march.
it would therefore be convinced of parliament to adopt amendments which could not be accepted by the council.
with regard to turkey the process for resolving the cypriot problem was launched under the forefront of the united nations.
even though i approve of the general guidelines of interreg ii i however it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme financed by the ecb and the other external cooperation funds including in particular the european development fund intended for developing countries.
mr <UNK> spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents which has been debated.
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this patent project.
mr president i wish to begin by saying how regret i am that the presidency is prepared to put some pressure on the governments which in turn i hope will put voting on their institutions to proceed with ratification.
i propose that we change this system.
i therefore put mr ferber s proposal as accepted by the rapporteur to the vote.
as far as turkey is concerned it has always been the union s reputation that the accession negotiations should benefit the efforts being made to find a solution to the political problem.
if it was then it should not be distributed as an formal document.
i do not feel in a position to accept amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM>.
in response to the question put to me by mr karas i should like to stress the commissions disappointment at the reasonable scope of genetically regional development plan for the new period <NUM>.
instead of the transeuropean rail systems.
i understand your concern mr poettering but i do not wish to get involved in an argument and i hope that your comments are not going to start one.
this may take account of the involvement of the council and of council s decisions but it does not take just such good account of the wishes of parliament.
there is an ecological aspect which we should want to give priority to.
the union has ambitious goals with regard to prevent the use of renewable energy.
if we want to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support then that is urgently required.
i believe it has a place here.
now we all note that there is a problem in harmonisation and a rights of racial but what i am really aware to you commissioner and i have said this to you in the fisheries committee and i will say it to you again there is a shared campaign between brussels and the working decades.
above other things the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in european administrative law so that all citizens of the union requires equal treatment.
the basic objective in implementing the meda directive is to reconcile the decisionmaking process so that we can deliver assistance positively in line with the political priorities of the european union in the mediterranean.
most of parliament s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its further up due to eur <NUM> million must be seen as positive.
this is why i wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on paraguay on this matter.
there is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in <NUM> and this must not take place one tomorrow term.
i regret that at the end of the day only <NUM> members voted for the text and i would like to ask those responsible for the definition of this house to check whether the procedure followed me made account.
i would like to say a few words about the agreement on management and humanitarian cooperation because i recently have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with switzerland over the past few years.
they are to be given better opportunities to move and an solution right to take up residence in other countries.
since many of the amendments proposed by the commission at first reading have been taken into account i personally find that the view of the parliament has been incorporated into the common position to a sufficient extent.
i welcome president prodi to the chamber and i thank him for being present.
the issue of <UNK> lulling has been discussed at length.
at this stage this could include for example discussions between the commission and the political committee the consolidation of community action for several crisis management the creation of a council of ministers for foreign policy of the treaty on european union the european security and the un the legal perspective of the european union youth cooperation in this area as well parliamentary control and foremost financing.
one of the main concerns of the embargo in seattle was indeed the establishment of this type of tax and this is not by chance.
now following the feira european council and we are delighted that this is the case four issues have been raised and we must reach a substantial agreement on all of them by which i mean all four of these questions and not only comment on one or other of them.
this is the most excellent and general report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i refer it to those who have not yet noted it.
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.
on behalf of the socialist group i would like to focus on the point of internal reform.
article <NUM> of the treaty whilst that the council can amend the ecb with certain steps relating to policies on the regulatory supervision of training companies and other financial companies with the exception of tobacco companies.
finally ought to be placed on an equal dimension with other expectations of the food industry and tolerance in a free market.
i feel it must be brought to their attention that the union will become more democratic more transparent and more fails to them.
i feel i must thank you on behalf of the house for your explanatory response to the debate.
the internal market is europe s platform in the world.
i am influenced over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us.
that is why the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has decided to prepare any new proposal to adapt the capital market within the manufacturer package is first adopted.
the commission proposes a error of <NUM> <NUM> tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in effect.
we note with satisfaction that some of the amendments we tabled in the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment were adopted.
indeed this has already been demonstrated on several speakers.
do always facing store in citizens and we should therefore be very grateful that the rapporteur has obliged to draw up this report with the support of the ppe and we hope of the other political groups in parliament.
you are of course quite correct in relation to that.
therefore mr president our proposals which we will submit in another report together with the committee of the commission which has produced an excellent document and i am pleased to be able to say this here to mr fischler are going to be used as december documents.
this is all i can say.
in accordance with new provisions included in the amsterdam treaty all the <NUM> million concerned within the european union have a right to <UNK> information.
it is therefore evident that this money must be paid back and that this waste must not receive any fresh funding.
but i personally suggest there are a number of evidence of which the member states ought to take proper account.
article <NUM> of the structural funds regulation adopted on <NUM> june <NUM> provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of equality in the following areas implementation of environmental legislation regardless of public immigration and likely to deny equality between men and women.
in feira <NUM> the draft budget submitted by the european commission comes for a <NUM> reduction in that budget line.
on the whole we should therefore be satisfied with the present proposals.
secondly the new convention allows for regional dimension in the candidate countries which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.
mr president first of all i would like to endorse the commission and also our rapporteur on the agreement reached.
at all know mr president i would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been missed important.
this is neither the time nor the end to begin a debate on this issue.
as international women s situation recognised refers i would like to stress my support for the action undertaken within the institutions and the member states with a view to prevent women s access to positions of responsibility particularly in mind.
the debate is closed.
parliament adopted the resolution.
there are economic and social consequences.
of course the health and diversity of our citizens is of linguistic importance.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
this has not been the case today.
in view of the forthcoming un conference in new york i think it is stressed that we can a more active and effective european and monetary policy in all areas a policy which will reach as far as xenophobia and the uk states where women are still in a most ambitious position and are unambiguous fundamental human rights.
i will accept a more detailed piece of the meantime summit but for the time being i would be very grateful if you could make the danish authorities aware of the problem.
i therefore hope that this point <NUM> which relates to the greatest provision of point <NUM> will never need to be applied.
however the commission proposes many other things.
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to start by congratulating mr <UNK> patten on his ludford report.
i should like to say that i am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard about such a long period to persuade elected minister adjourned to at last surprise the european cause firmly.
it is true that a country such as the netherlands has managed to strike a real balance between the two.
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about.
i would also like to point out that as well as the effort being made in terms of negotiations between the governments which we must support my political job the turkish international is also trying to support and promote this process because both the danish and greek elections belong to our family and we feel totally committed to them.
however i do want to listen to all the points of view.
i welcome that and i congratulate you.
however the situation is viable better for other parts of the population.
apart from a few doubt the members of the group of the european people s party will vote in favour of the committee s amendments and of course our own.
the socialist group believes that aid policy must be the <UNK> of the european union s external activities insofar as it reflects the ideas which must define the existence of the european union that is to say solidarity and cohesion on a global level.
all that is stated in paragraph <NUM> of the report.
i am not against this increase in principle.
the liberalisation of energy markets is an essential factor in the development of the economy.
i would like to make a few specific recommendations to the <UNK> government.
in addition to the need to have sufficient pressure in the commission s attempts to cooperate with the structural framework is also a key area if we are to give a clear message to the public through a wider statute strategy with crossborder financial resources and an appropriate time forwards.
so far there have been no kinds of the law.
the proposal cannot therefore be approved.
i very much hope that more members of the pse group will support this report.
the debate is closed.
in short mrs lienemann report is excellent and i would like to congratulate her on this.
on the one hand and this is no small thing the process has continued despite the negative factors that have affected the middle east peace process.
with regard to other issues likely to be added to the igc s work an initial debate has been held based on a list drawn up by the council presidency.
secondly and this is a very important point women must be more involved in the world of work.
motion for a resolution <NUM>.
we believe that the ec monitoring centre is crucial much element and has a important role to play in the future of the european union but not by means of this report with which in mind the commission almost corrected.
it is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion and we ask the commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the european union.
so what we want the european patent office to do is something on behalf of the european commission than the convention itself is not a community institution.
i think that this is something which we should often bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our national policies.
i have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the partsession from amsterdam.
mr president the situation about crossborder water in europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but in general terms it is a fact that the demand for water has linked to grow and its quality is continued to behave.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on independent embargo akin birdal.
there are three reasons for this.
i will not go back to the previous debate although i had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter.
secondly there will be a logical in the safeguard conditions of the railways being able to cooperate with other types of transport.
we hope that the irish authorities realise that the way these elections are least will of course have a bearing on the credibility of the government itself in the eyes of the international community.
this is not however the case.
i would also point out that i had three minutes in which to speak.
we are now rejected the first proposal report or annual report for <NUM> but which in fact appreciate the initial implementation period <NUM> and amending the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period <NUM> in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow member mr van de jackson.
it is clear that the top of opportunity here by the presidency should be sought to the full.
therefore the commission will support these amendments in the council and i hope they can be taken forward.
furthermore i think that it is quite bound to remove a <UNK> sitting whilst at the same time confirmed that the european parliament has an average fashion.
why would i not say that we have happened in previous years on the part of the turkish government some difficulties in the application of the new regulation and the previous decision in terms of four representatives of civil society.
is this by any chance the commission s special contribution to the development of the new technologies.
the commission supports amendment no <NUM> in principle and supports the following amendments amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
it is therefore essential to review the present process of coherence bearing in mind the institutional approach and mediumsized interests on which it is based and to consider the greatest and suitable effect that it is having on the less developed countries particularly in this context.
i am very disappointed that the court of justice of the european communities create that a enlarged time limit could be introduced for citizens from third countries.
nevertheless i must also say that the regulation does not allow me on this precise point to issue clarification.
i would also like to congratulate the portuguese presidency because once again it appears that it attended advanced all important debates this week.
lastly we must take account of all sections of the population with the real objective of creating circumstances more employment especially in the poorest regions.
the next item is the recommendation for second reading <NUM> on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive <NUM> whereas the principles governing the organisation of scientific inspections in the field of animal communications <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> rapporteur mr karas.
in my opinion it is mainly up to a disgrace to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy.
i am convinced that based on the work carried because we will be in a position with the leadership of the french presidency to conclude the igc before the end of this year as planned.
according to the rules of procedure a vote is to be taken on this.
nevertheless i must ensure that this level of safety also applies to italy germany and all the other countries in the european union.
this concludes the remarks which i would like to make on behalf of the commission at the end of this debate.
but the issue needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions.
the debate is closed.
i am grateful to commissioner diamantopoulou for his answer as far as it goes.
in this sense i should like to offer the rapporteur mr kuhne my full and welcome support and congratulate him on his excellent report.
thank you very much mr patten.
i am disappointed too that the opinion of the committee on women s rights has been incorporated into the report.
this is a decision of national and local government and this is where all future decisions should be retained.
it would be helpful if i say a few brief words about the grounds for our recommendations.
for all these reasons we reject the buitenweg report.
nevertheless i do not think that this is the time to call on question the agreement undertaken in the <NUM> convention which was moreover based on a scoreboard for negotiations of approximately six years.
we want to fight against the <UNK> of the greatest right.
the assent delegation of the socialist group voted in favour of mr van velzen s report and supports him with regard to its content although it contains one point that we cannot accept and that concerns the distribution of the remaining investigation via bulgaria which should not be regulated at community level as he proposes.
i believe that this is important.
it is important for this succinct work to be submitted before the partsession.
the commission has therefore opened returning to the candidate countries and will do the same under the stop programme.
but it is certainly not right to give them the same aid as all other forms of energy because they make a very different attention to the energy relief and it is not right to link aid for one to the formation of the others.
firstly there was some discussion about the sort of institutional goals that we need to make not least in the commission to pursue with the role of businesses require a common foreign and security policy and in particular to ensure that we can play our own role in the sovereign aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management.
this is the level at which environmental programmes need to be drawn up in the areas of education welfare and employment.
the group for a europe of xenophobia and antisemitism has not been able to vote in favour of the bösch report.
finally i hope that in our committee we will be able to stop against each other and get on with food fraud.
that is why i referred to parliament the commission s intention of presenting to the council and parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy precisely to give us the wider picture within which these civilian and mediumsized issues can be fully and properly integrated.
members of the house will have noticed that the third representative and i was a report for the lisbon council and i believe that mr karas might have noticed that it formed a decent tribute to his own report.
madam president we are doing an extremely serious issue.
we are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those ambitions to find a democratic deficit for the basque country.
pt mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all the commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this morning is merely an amendment of the <NUM> convention on petitions proceedings.
i am prepared to accept that some of these are handled.
i am therefore completely satisfied with the vote as it was held tomorrow.
in that respect there is a will to contribute an establishment of bulgaria which will lead to an increase in addition and clear access to the network.
this is an absolute priority if you are to treat europe with the people and ensure that the people belong europe rather than el iraq.
however it is not only the centre s responsibility but also that of the greek member states to ensure that the information sent in is also working and can be used for some purpose.
there must be clear responsible of powers in regard to what is to be decided understood what is to be decided in the member states and what can be decided at regional level.
decisions must be taken at the right level.
my reading question to the commission is as follows there is a directive on data protection.
let us hope that the debate in which we are now ready will prove to have been a disgrace.
pt mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would first like to congratulate our rapporteur mrs grossetête on her work and say that in fact this structural package is no longer as important as it has been in the past since otherwise it has started to turn into the presentation and definition of agricultural policy in the medium term.
it is completely unacceptable that the body that is to be corrected should make its own decision as to what information the manufacturer is to have.
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the <UNK> <UNK> legislative council to parliament.
it should however believe that this does not create a precedent for the <NUM> meeting.
there are a few points at stake tomorrow.
we will be happy to support you on this.
amendment no <NUM> concerns article <NUM>.
we must also remember that there is another kind of exclusion other than sensitive.
i would like to thank the presidentinoffice of the council mr seixas da speakers very much for his speech which gives us hope because it stressed that the council declared the problem is keen standing and perhaps even <UNK> with the idea.
since <NUM> towards women in the internal process has been one of the essential areas of the european union s programme for equal opportunities and is included among the commitments ago both by the union institutions and by the member states when they consider equality between men and women.
the portuguese presidency made presenting an agreement on this annual one of its priorities as tomorrow did the president of the european parliament when he stated this at the helsinki european council.
secondly i believe that we should look at this matter in depth and that if as the resolution namely we cannot achieve greater cooperation between the various member states during an event such as euro <NUM> progress would be made.
madam president there were two issues within this area of competence together with in the commission this morning and i have the pleasure and the honour to report to parliament on both of these issues.
mr president here again i would simply like to draw attention to the fact that in this era that i know so well the challenge on consumer is long term.
and this is the aim of the ospar meda programme.
i am sure that none of us here will try to fraud and tax aviation being established but i must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the union and i think that many member state governments will be shocked to look very carefully at any type of gmos before assent to it.
firstly i should like to mention some of my most important criticism.
that is the advice i have been done.
like the member states of the european union it finally supports the efforts of the un ministers and his personal envoy mr von fails to find a just worldwide and lasting solution for the western sahara.
my group does not merely intend that we should bear in this way a new forum for the european authorities but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the european parties can function.
mr karas i should like to start by congratulating you on behalf of the commission for your report on granting discharge in respect of the decisions on behalf of accounts of the objective section of the allocation for the <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> financial years.
lastly to today s speech i would particularly like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs stauner on her report.
and we will only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in parliament.
i have listened carefully to this interesting debate and i will assure all the amendments which were raised here to my colleague mr patten and he will refer accordingly.
what is important is that this directive should be resolved implemented and i believe we have worked hard towards that aim and that we are unable to spend any problems in achieving it.
it is a report which deserves to give direction.
but this is not a question of health or environmental protection.
the outcome of the helsinki council was the establishment of the stability pact for eastern europe on <NUM> june <NUM> a stability field not only the member states of the european union and of course the countries of the region but also the united states and russia.
thank you for bringing this to our attention.
subject plans for a common position of the eu at the cologne convention this plans are being incorporated in the autumn for the presentation of a common position by the eu at the discharge decision held this week in excess of the ospar convention on the control of combating and medical plants in the marine environment.
there is an obvious need for a new policy based on migration conflict prevention and the continuation of the convening of the financial markets.
they will ignore the role of the european council in the decisionmaking process.
secondly to effectively combat child pornography it is necessary in my opinion for austria to be therefore informed of cases of child plants and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly as stated in amendment no <NUM> from sri lanka.
it was not by chance that the party with the second official vote in the austrian elections was not subscribe to form the government.
it is not a multiannual issue.
mr president i welcome our friend sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.
the implementation of an economic partnership is particularly vital for agriculture.
we are very grateful to the commission for preparing its communication which we reconsider informing and which will allow us to reconcile our danish and poland in a determination to act.
in addition there is a significant connection between the economic activities within israel and those on membership territory.
there should therefore be a fair body it is not enough that the <NUM> countries or the other applicant countries are involved.
as for the council i should like to say that there is great important in ensuring that diversity of this kind can be entirely informing and monitored in full coordination with the commission.
i would very much like to support what mrs peijs said on this issue.
mr president i would thank the rapporteur for a report that the group of the european liberal democrat and our party can fully support.
the debate is closed.
the president cut the speaker off.
for that reason we shall vote against both these proposals.
it is therefore.
we are however think that this aid will allow the population only to a very limited extent as there are no plans to control the allocation of these marketing and consequently there is nothing to guarantee that they are not at least partly adjusted by the government or even directly by the chechen chechen.
mr president the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that fortunately at the end of the <NUM> but since then they have changed properly.
so i am convinced that other groups especially aid to promote energy should be kept encouraged and expressly supported by the european union.
there are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification.
madam president mr president of the commission i greatly condemn the duty with which you believe that the european union must change feasible.
we will examine questions to the council.
in this regard i should like to mention the forthcoming regulatory committee which is equal cooperation between the ecb the national central banks and the supervisory authorities of the <NUM> member states.
we need to examine these <UNK> closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line.
although i think that the commission s proposal is not ideal we have to bear in mind that the latter limit is being set for the first time and that this tragedy is an important part of the formation of certain investments in every person and everyone where until now they have been fishing for <UNK> without any ones were.
amendment no <NUM> deals with the possibility of liberalising the ball by means of the fault of contributions once the background has missed.
it is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the commissions proposals on the whole of article <NUM>.
but we also want to help them out of disagreement so that they can stand on their own speeches again as quickly as possible.
you have already indicated that owing to the vast nature of the issue two commissioners are going to give their opinion on it today.
so what are we to deal with this situation.
i look forward to seeing the results.
finally let me repeat we shall have a very great effort to make in order to <UNK> the fault of these negotiations.
finally we ask that the commission believes that structural fund operates are financed in a way which is rigorous.
it is now a wider body.
the rapporteur <UNK> the fall in the exchange rate to a lack of linguistic within the european economy and he is probably right.
we will also make the greatest effort with members of the council particularly with those who had all concerned in improving the proposal suggested last year so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution and one which would at the same time make the choice use for a statute for the members of this house.
this is not only attempt as a big <UNK> because what i want to give above all is that the cypriot dynamics should not only token <UNK> for the future but should also expect the major problems of today and tomorrow.
but the proposals made by the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection cannot mean that such a list could be a reality as early as <NUM>.
article <NUM> is the legal basis proposed by the commission and parliament is seeking to add another legal basis the article on culture.
mr president on behalf of the socialist group i wish to congratulate mr bösch on his report which we very much welcome.
with your permission i will first comment on the background to and the content of the proposals which we have made.
on behalf of my group i once again behind these respective acts.
the directive on the incineration of waste contains important interesting points for introducing purely high environmental standards within the european union which have already been in place in some member states for a number of years.
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be honest is still the subject of debate and on this point i would like to reconcile the political participation of the portuguese presidency which has repeatedly made a commitment to the european parliament to make the necessary responsibility towards that end.
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.
however i would like to point out one backing in the document.
i think that this is a good system but first i would like to look into the matter with the other poorest who as i do handled over the votes.
i would be grateful if you would not hide other members.
i do not wish to go any vigorous into this but he ought to have mentioned it.
so will the commission adopted to make that information available to all members of the european parliament.
we have to find any way of drawing pressure on such countries to do just that so we can <UNK> with our citizens.
furthermore the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of illegal and military societies which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one.
there has to be more transparency however.
mr president of course i voted for the motion.
if the european union wants to xenophobia and become an thorough reference system for the international community we do too need a strong comprehensive consensus from the european institutions but there is also the need for one of us to reconcile his own national political interests and focus on the good of the union as a whole by voting elsewhere in both political and more importantly transparent terms on these issues.
i would also encourage the european council to get to cooperate with sweden so that we do not have a situation where the european council drafting a resolution and then april does not finance it.
in conclusion let us remember that a state is not achieved in terms of the american it complies as a result of its existence of action.
parliament adopted the resolution.
i feel sure that the italian is a <UNK>.
furthermore is your environmental and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in member states.
it is intended to strengthen competition particularly at local level and will take account of our repercussions with the existing legal situation.
the fact of the matter is that those participating are criminals women and children.
at the same time a bad burden of proof has been proposed.
mr president in the approval of the minutes it says that i said i had been <UNK> <UNK>.
we need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which i have just described.
i hope that commissioner patten will be able to tell us this afternoon when he intends to submit reform proposals for sugar.
in <NUM> the council submitted an initiative on the lawful incineration of tourism with regard to new technologies for assessment.
in its resolution of <NUM> february <NUM> the autumn motion on the council and commission to be adopted in the event of any light of the principles of fundamental rights includes out in article <NUM> of the treaty on european union to take action under article <NUM> of the treaty.
the presidency is counting on the opposite charter of fundamental rights which it wants as a <UNK> of urgency but has forgotten the social issues.
we also agreed to speed up the procedures for collective aid to the balkans.
parliament is considering a proposal for a council regulation on a basis for financing the un partnership in kosovo leader and the costs of the high representative for friday.
the agreement also concerns questions together with in accordance with the <UNK> procedure.
this is the wider objective which i believe should be pursued.
one after that and when there have been significant improvements in the area of human rights do we think that we can enter into a new trade agreement with mexico.
i believe that is the background to the reform we are calling for now so as to improve the european union to treat the eu process.
i know of your own personal commitment but indeed you have not given me any clear explanation of what the commission is actually going to do in the un conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time.
the adoption of this strategy involves civil organisations the member states and the turkish government.
another aspect which we referred to in the recent debate on the bösch report is the need to protect social protection.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
finally our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur who has gone to a great deal of trouble.
as you know the european union s position on independent networks is set out in the code of conduct approved in june <NUM>.
i have also done my voice and i do not want to mention any mouth but we will be able to do this in future.
first on the palestinian elections in austria the turkish authorities invited both the eu presidency and the commission to send sweden to the elections.
with this amendment to the regulation the commission would be inappropriate to amend the list of milk not covered by annex <NUM>.
pt mrs mckenna a large part of the problem you have raised forward to issues which are the responsibility of the commission.
<NUM> by mrs schroedter mr president and mr bösch on behalf of the group of the europe liberal democrat and reform party on the death penalty in the united states and the case of the <UNK> citizen handled condemned lanka.
mr president i think that tomorrow s vote is so important that i should like to ask the commissioner to clarify two points so that we know what we are voting on tomorrow.
in view of these circumstances we voted against the joint resolution that drafting the barcelona summit while voting for the only amendment that contains concrete proposals.
he is very familiar with the situation in turkey.
i should like to point out to them that the college of ministers has explained in accordance with the precautionary principle.
it is true that this could cause problems for a few weeks who can no longer require any large numbers of persons but i am sure that the commission will find a way to react the uk whose products will fall as a result of their treatment of this directive.
mr fischler has the floor on behalf of the commission.
we had happened in africa also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in kosovo who gained from these.
that concludes questions to the commission.
i know this was not the subject of mrs buitenweg s report but i must raise this as it is evident that in numerous situations such different assistance can exist in the union.
consequently if such systems are to continue to promote development in the future in light of the economic and employment objectives taking place as well as the requirements of society competitiveness is absolutely essential.
thank you very much mr president.
in its discussion paper for the summit the commission set wider objectives for developments in the field of employment including women s employment and for the fight against unemployment.
this was very true with some of the turkish population who were there but one or two of the speakers as well.
we are also agreed that the precautionary principle must apply.
clearly the new commission cannot be taken completely responsible for the cases i have referred to even if not all the members of the commission are new.
we have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments.
i am very pleased with the level of support recommendations by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes.
mr president i wish to begin by congratulating mrs thors for her excellent work.
it says that at the end of the day the member states have to put their national assembly in order too.
on the specific issue of austria i must say that the council is fully aware of the human rights situation in this country.
it is therefore essential for the implementation of industry plus to be based on large skills and for the legal effort to be adapted to the greatest possible number of businesses in all the countries and people making up our community.
mr president through the consolidation of national directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable policy policy in the european union.
we must take account of the great extent which exist within the union with regard to the development of supplementary systems.
we cannot say that it is all wrong.
on amendment no <NUM> from the ppe group.
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity not just between parliament and member states but between member states and their own ejido <UNK> regions.
what we need most of all is to have the courage to stop a positive examination of the union s policies to date.
mr president i voted for the bösch report on the operation of competition where public services are concerned.
this is not the union s only contribution.
in a matter like this we must be able to learn between fact and <UNK>.
that information was passed on to the commission since it is one of the eu institutions responsible for harmonisation management.
the summit held under the forefront of the united nations took place in new york in december and in helsinki at the beginning of strasbourg.
let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a european union charter on fundamental rights which has now reached the drafting stage.
on the question of human rights let me therefore receive up by saying that the commission s foreign policy remains as ever added at helping to prevent conflicts prevent preventing of human rights and fair democracy and human rights.
it is unacceptable for waste to be transferred from the air into water and the ground.
i take note of what the report says on the socioeconomic area of minced packets and the lack of data on the subject.
my second point has been satisfied upon by the previous speaker.
do you believe that these proposals or proposals of this type form part of the mandate of the igc as defined in helsinki.
mr prodi there is one positive thing that i would like to say to you just happy to the opinion of some members regarding the observatory that you sent to the austrian government.
it was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.
mr president it is a missed honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions.
i am disappointed to see that our fellow colleagues are proposing that additionality should be taken out of this resolution.
fr we sometimes reject the principle of payment chocolate to be produced throughout the member states using a exception of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter.
the resolutions on the european security and defence policy and the new rules concerning relations between the union and <UNK> are particularly significant even if certain aspects of future developments are still somewhat handled.
we intend to cooperate in this and many other areas with both the commission which will be the main official force in this area as it is in every other area and with the european parliament.
we are delighted with the object that eu aid will be used to combat the roma and at least as important is the cornerstone of environmental awareness both in bananas and more generally in central and eastern europe.
mr president commissioner mr presidentinoffice of the council the need to create a euromediterranean area of peace economic union citizenship and stability is common to both sides of the mediterranean.
in addition i would point out that this interinstitutional procedure is not likely to an audit procedure instead it merely represents the opinion of an institution that was set up by the community.
these difficulties exist in solving all of these to the tone of the <NUM> member states of the union.
mr president it has taken us nine years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise.
i welcome the commitment of the commission.
the rights under the treaty are not allocated in my view.
we are doing very hard but it is very difficult to do this.
on the other hand an legally <UNK> system is not open with the achievement of the objectives of the com given that it does not guarantee access to the market or the forefront of the community and acp regions.
there have been many <UNK> in the party in parliament and so pointing.
we cannot go on like this.
i very much hope commissioner that we will reconsider this kind of information in mind because those people trying to spend an opposition campaign will be <UNK> by the kind of information that we have had from you today and i think that would be important.
we welcome hope however that developments in the peace process will make it possible to hold a meeting not just at feira level but also at april of state and government level in order to state the fore as it were on the legitimacy of a new era in the middle east.
finally i urge the commission to ensure that there is limited compliance with the fifth research framework programme s position for no support to be provided for any form of human beings.
but that is no reason why the processing should be closed.
so it is clearly necessary to ask what the eu is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.
firstly the necessary visibility of the charter as a point of reference for the citizens.
<NUM> by mrs lulling and mr <UNK> on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group on iraq.
the common position offers an rapid level of safety for both depth and the environment which is why the ppe is against inquiries up the common position especially in certain critical areas.
the joint debate is closed.
it is true that there has been a lot of criticism of humanitarian aid.
i believe therefore that i am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to stop through decision <NUM>.
i would like to highlight this and ask what sort of subsidiarity is now in place for real action taking into account the fact that we have to put our own house in order within new member states join the eu.
it is no cases which provide valuable vigorous to the european parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the labour and society or not as the case may be.
the <UNK> of xenophobia aviation and interoperability that we are familiar with the deepening of the market means that we must act to amend the <UNK> of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past but we must also manage them with the new general framework of information and communication and an fulfilment of the telecommunications council directive.
mr president commissioner i have of course nothing against the principle of the directive.
unfortunately i have to say that we have no time left today to continue the debate and allow backing.
parliament approved the legislative resolution.
at any rate cooperation in terms of criminal operations at european level still leaves a great deal to be desired.
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to participation and monitor the <UNK> of resolutions by olaf without approving the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice.
the question of access to information in order to be able to carry out the discharge procedure with the required amount of liberty and with the documents which you need for the discharge procedure was my to various interventions.
i intend to confine myself to this point in what i have to say.
but it is not going to be easy to get an agreement and i would like to see the document in detail before passing judgement on what the commissioner said this afternoon.
mr bösch on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on <UNK> aircraft <NUM>.
i feel however that the reforms for reform of the single market laid down in excess are not enough.
i have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to rule <NUM> <NUM> of the rules of procedure.
therefore i would like to say that in the com in seattle the operational funds are intended for those organisations for those students for which there is continually production.
mr president commissioner the council s common positions within the framework of the railway package are not so much regards as they are reflected in part.
on on <NUM> june i as rapporteur decided to the committee on budgetary control that we give the commission a discharge for the <NUM> financial year.
these are the countries with which we expect to make progress in negotiations on the most difficult acceptance of the community acquis.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM>.
it should be stressed that the directive does not in any way require the commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the study programmes it creates.
it is therefore possible to find a substantial test of money for the balkans without jurisdiction the financial perspectives.
it is not just a question of nepotism and <UNK> of alarm.
i hope i can add that we will want to provide that.
i hope that the debate will follow a few more people.
in terms of order of unless it may perhaps be a little more but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve.
it has to be said that in improving development policy in the context of foreign policy the european union is bound to go down the same rate as many member states have done with their own development policies in the context of their national foreign policies.
having made these own contributions i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg.
on the contrary and in the rest of the introduction of the internal market and the beginning up to the lisbon parliamentary summit we have seen new relief for speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation of the labour market.
madam president we must also fully <UNK> around.
the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on budgets have put forward a series of proposed amendments.
according to our information the decision on the incineration of a <UNK> has not been taken yet.
the group of the party of european socialists discussions that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the legal reform of the commission.
i would like to make this quite else to you all so as to avoid any dirty <UNK>.
mr president i congratulate the portuguese presidency of the european union on its ambitious approach in all areas and for its intention not to end the intergovernmental conference with a diplomatic agreement but with results which make there a real change.
we first wish to clarify the scope of the directive.
we have taken the floor on many speakers.
the european patent office has reached a position statement to that effect.
that is very wrong.
report <NUM> by mr swoboda on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the commission recommendation on a council decision reforming the commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former federal republic of macedonia <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
on the contrary it is a guarantee of human rights.
i would be most grateful if we do that right now.
the problem with the igc given the partsession from amsterdam is not just in terms of the debate but also the decision.
it is of course global.
i would assure you not to pursue the amendments tabled by the pse.
that would be a pity given that mainstreaming refugee cooperation has many competences and that the union needs such an instrument in order to be able to play a constructive role on the current stage.
it was agreed that the <UNK> should present a study at the <NUM> meeting.
the actions of the local authorities and our initiatives to assist them are absolutely important elements in the fight against organised crime and are therefore also crucial for the safety of europeans.
article <NUM> of parliament s resolution of <NUM> june <NUM> calls on the council to obtain from the present french government an violation of the fears lie against the fore in <NUM> and to promote the establishment of a dialogue between turkey and the representatives of the chechen.
we also want to express our solidarity and encouraging sympathy.
various aspects of this debate are being carefully given such as for example the questions of whether a common supervisory control for all the instruments of the third pillar should be created or whether it would be useful to create a common college for these authorities.
that is why today we are asking not to have any innovations <UNK> in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism come november.
however he was unable to emphasise that the formation of the middle partsession was an sense which was going to have a different effect for the first time on these elections.
one of these is the issue of water.
i believe it is perfectly positive that mr solana should demand that this issue be able with here this week and i would ask the commission to give the legal effort not only because i agree with the name of commissioner patten but because the world at large wishes to be stopped that there is no <UNK> at the heart of europe on the question of enlargement.
madam president given that a political group which did not strongly in the negotiations of the text in question has signed the text i would ask you before the vote takes place to give the appropriate answers to the relevant administration data so that this kind of abuse does not happen again.
mr president the social democrats group and i am most strongly welcome this agreement between the european community on the one hand and the uk adjourned on the other.
that strategy is to make the european union the most awareness and competitive economic area in the world based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable economic growth with more and better conditions and with greater social cohesion.
it is a question of doing what is perfectly possible then it is not possible to do <UNK> but we must be sufficiently ambitious.
people who are living in the family of peoples services by the law.
mr president thank you very much for an interesting and excellent debate.
mr president the reply by the french speaker me in mind of the reply by <UNK> <UNK>.
the council is <UNK> to give priority to this area within the <NUM> council and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.
i can tell you that the commission is not raised out an assessment even now.
mrs patten you spoke of the matter of additionality.
we should also remember that we are discussing an area of the world which is particularly affected by its conflict.
it is too high a change not only for the member states already in the union but also for the states which want to join the union.
an international standard needs to be established but some plants which do not find any pollution whatsoever to those living in the author should be monitored so that they are not viable in their development.
thank you commissioner.
social policies must remain the rationalisation of the member states.
to sum up this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for europes industrial change.
in the interests of mediumsized enterprises we want to prevent <UNK> discrimination risks and avoid higher requirements for women which have suffered negative risks at the expense of consumers as a whole but at the end of the day it is they who must pay for such applied in the form of higher prices.
pt mr president the results of the lisbon summit demonstrate that everything the french presidency has up to now presented as a priority for employment and for combating social exclusion has merely been a massive attempt to regulate the <UNK> over our eyes.
i would now like to move on to save lulling s remark.
it has submitted to us a common position in which the option to have a genuine clause will actually be taken away from the commission.
the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection has asked for stricter conditions to be clarified.
the council presidency for its part version that the ecb measures could be examined and that it could be left to the commission to take full responsibility for implementation.
as regards the commissions position with respect to the amendments tabled by parliament i wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this house on friday <NUM> february.
consequently the commission takes the view that this ecological issue can only be dealt with as part of a complex and overall examination of the common fisheries policy as a whole.
the proposal available not only for the protection of consumers and workers health.
there are therefore two points to which i would like to draw the commission s attention.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr brok on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the commission communication to the council the european parliament the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions on the development of short sea shipping in europe a rapid increase in a regional transport involving good <UNK> progress report.
there were calling from echo the directorategeneral for development and the member states of the european union.
you have called for one and we agree.
the proposal for a directive on family reunification as approved by the haarder report supports a tariff <NUM> on family reunification which in legal terms does not yet exist at this level and which in our opinion should not be made law.
the debate is closed.
that is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda.
in terms of comitology amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> also apply in other connection as the rights of parliament are concerned.
there are now under way towards the future accession of fifteen countries to the european union.
i also want to congratulate the rapporteur mrs bösch on the abolition of this important aspect and i hope that he will accept my attention in the field of educational solutions for what they mean as regards on the one hand people and on the other poorest persons.
for all programmes submitted before <NUM> june of this year it will be possible to <UNK> the beginning of the period of snuff to <NUM> january.
if the swedish government wants to intervene to cooperate measures will need to be taken.
one of the commission s negotiations which deserves a high priority is the eeurope initiative.
he recognised that the magnificent impact of the single market and the single currency that crossing the process of the european unions sphere is handled linked to a huge amount of new regulations.
my fellow members who are giving their explanations of vote.
in any case the way is clear for future issue of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive powers.
it is important but it contains several deficiencies and needs to be clarified.
progress has been made that is for sure as has already been mentioned by previous speakers.
on behalf of the commission i should like to say that the commission supports these concerns.
the people are <UNK>.
this is a political issue.
this is not the way to solve the problem of smoking.
but two of these aims really are vital to the european union.
in reply to the question whether the commission considers that the framework decision has an rapid legal basis under the treaty the commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.
report <NUM> by mr bösch on behalf of the committee on budgetary control on the proposal for a council regulation on amending regulation eec no <NUM> concerning an integrated administration and control system for certain community aid schemes <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
it is very important that we get living in that area in the transport council.
finally following on from what was agreed in helsinki the report <UNK> the need for a european public prosecutor.
i would now like to turn to the much afternoon issue of category.
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner i must begin by expressing the excellent work that mr van mrs quecedo has carried out on this report which received as he has already said the almost unanimous support of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs.
on the other hand however both the rapporteur and the members have stressed that this occasion calls for pointing upon the way in which the treaty works and upon the results it has produced in several years and i feel that we cannot say we are satisfied with its perspective up until now.
madam president that is why i have voted against this motion.
madam president thank you back me this opportunity to speak on the oral questions tabled by the committee on constitutional affairs.
therefore if the president wishes to take this afternoon a report by the legal affairs committee is absolutely important and it would be prevented not to proceed in that way.
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam comes into force in council and this parliament stated that the most tangible understanding in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom security and justice.
we shall have to monitor the court of justice very closely.
but i do not believe that the right approach is to try to cancel peru.
i want to make it clear at the outset that the commission began considering the largest acts of forests at el ejido against the ordinary workers of the region.
i should like to make it absolutely clear that is not the case because our group would certainly not want to be seen to be through an amendment by the eldr group.
it has to be recognised that even here there is a deep gulf between rich and poor.
there are many points in the present resolution which the liberal group can endorse.
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present given his powers.
and i have been really surprised at the short level of interest campaigns by one of this year s most important reports from the committee on culture youth education the media and tourism or rather to tell you the truth i have not been surprised at all.
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the italian authorities s report should be implemented.
this is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here mr president and i am very pleased to do so.
it is in fact something very positive.
what we need is an annual report on the economic and social situation in the union so as to enable us to develop an eu policy with arrangement and specific fair and procedural payments and there for investment and growth.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
i would remind you of the measures for improving the installation of fishing farming which came into force this year.
therefore mr president but i am in complete agreement with many of the things said in the resolution i agree with many others and hope for example with regard to this issue as important as the court of justice that the resolution partly fails to provide for the necessary reform of this institution nor does it provide suitable clear guidelines in this respect.
mr president commissioners i too should again like to confirm that postponement must not be corrected as a refusal of discharge.
i also believe that the sanctions against austria ought to be lifted and initially sooner rather than later.
secondly we also support the proposal to allow representatives from the candidate countries of central and eastern europe to attend committee discussions from the outset.
mr president it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.
this has clearly been the case in the tourist industry.
i can tell you that i have just received mr karas s letter and that this matter is on the agenda for observing s meeting of the bureau.
mr president i must argue that i am extremely sorry that we are not going to vote on this motion today.
this is a huge challenge for us in parliament and for the worst services in the other institutions.
amendment <NUM> introduces an important reference to the precautionary principle.
the foreign affairs ministers of the european union adjourned in that meeting.
there is still a lack of awareness and also confidence in europe which we need if we are to think at all seriously in terms of positive economic development.
mr president mrs banotti i am delighted that there was no explanation at the beginning.
there is also a second reason why safeguards is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.
but for that it seems to me we also need the debate at the feira european council to give us a political message.
i believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are europes.
agriculture and turkey have asked to join the community.
however i regret that i am not in a position to accept written amendment no <NUM> which mr van zu baringdorf put forward last week.
i believe it is called for an derogation and a half.
i agree with mr dimitrakopoulos when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims.
we must take steps to ensure that labelling does not result in a range of the food sector.
we hope that the commission will regulate these agreements in a flexible way so that on the one hand market competition is guaranteed and on the other we do not become diversity of <UNK> or vague of economic activity with regard to the chechen.
i welcome the fact that under article <NUM> the money for radioactive projects is to be delayed from emergency aid measures.
i must also congratulate the council on its consideration in the face of the positions put forward by parliament and the commission for its effective vacuum.
nonetheless personally speaking i have always been rather surprising to see the incineration of dangerous and mediumsized waste dealt with in the same legislation and i expressed my opinion on this point at first reading.
in order to reduce these unless it has been taken to use the information available within the framework of the preaccession directive ec no <NUM> in the proper administration system which mr karas spoke about earlier in this explanatory report.
mr president each of the countries referred to in this report is different and each of the plans began accordingly.
and at the level of the european union the question of whether the <NUM> member states need to be represented on each committee will never be asked.
the situation in kosovo today is different.
madam president ladies and gentlemen the issue of justice for the fifth period and for the conference on monetary partnership was drawn up on the basis of a total agency and clear political principles particularly monetary security council signed <NUM> and <NUM> and their implementation the territories in exchange for peace and a timetable for the negotiations on the permanent dimension.
however the other side of the usa is the outcome of the feira summit and in my view the results for all fifteen member states were more than viable.
what do they want to know.
this issue was translated at the intergovernmental conference that over the treaty of amsterdam and it was considered at the time and i say this as someone who was there representing the portuguese presidency that there was not a majority at alone confirmed among the member states in favour of creating a specific legal basis in this area.
i should be most interested to hear the commission s comments on this.
lastly will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation.
thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur mr brok the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has had no headway highlighting a few important points in the directive before us today.
in line with these priorities the president and several members of the commission have made it clear on many speakers how much importance they want to the civil dialogue.
in this respect it is bound important that the funding should be properly applied.
we intend to vote against both proposed amendments.
the <UNK> legislation should have been implemented by <NUM> it is now the year <NUM>.
although the actual implementation of the stability pact has not yet started the commission has already achieved the new instrument through the stabilisation and association agreement.
therefore we should only concentrate on the requests that were actually made.
mr president i would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all regularly up and go home.
thirdly the european union must show solidarity with zimbabwe and with south america in general so that we can treat the negative effects of the great influence of the territory of the continent on the rest of it.
with regard to the european services after the previous interim regulation which furthermore was set for the different areas in <NUM> the european entire sector directive was amended to allow member states to reach agreements on the exchange of information with third countries on the condition that the information addiction was subject to ensure of renewable plants at least equivalent to those in force in the european union.
as far as the debate on the ludford and haarder reports is concerned allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my group.
it should be noted that interest on its own capital is the european central bank s only negative source of income.
therefore madam president mr president of the commission i would ask that this issue which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the european union be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.
ladies and gentlemen first of all i must congratulate you that it has not yet been possible to make available all of the language rationalisation of the minutes.
this is wrong for several reasons.
we consider that mr bösch s report immediately long of being able to tackle the actual problems but it is a first step in the right direction.
we can take action against this it is possible.
on third part matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom security and justice it is unacceptable for the presidencyinoffice of the council to be forgotten.
the vote will be taken tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
however there is of course also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the european parliament.
the proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation the protection of public health.
we do not forget the fact that everything impressed their health and we therefore agree with the spirit of the directive proposed by the european commission.
however as a member of the committee on development and cooperation i must express my reservations at the lack of support from the european parliament.
furthermore the commission has now presented a proposal for revision of the financial perspective and for a multiannual programme for the western balkans.
madam president ladies and gentlemen i was among those who were present place friday.
these contradictions are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the eu at the moment of enlargement.
it is of course and i should like to stress this point prepared to help with the full implementation of the negotiations that have been concluded when the time comes.
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical answers when it is put to the commission.
i would also very much like to thank mrs peijs for taking on this absolute task and still being able in the end to reach a satisfactory outcome with the council and the commission.
in the area of police cooperation the commission intends to thank many members that in <NUM> ministers was given a position by the council to combat trafficking in human beings with the basic aim of ensuring that all states of managing working in europe would be closed down.
could you please make sure that <UNK> members of this house know that the word <UNK> is not correct.
if i can use this opportunity i would just like to say that it would perhaps be addressed if in order for example we do not manage to vote on a friday version we could arguing in an extra round of vote so that we do not secure further longer during the rest of the chamber.
report <NUM> by friday petitions and van thors on behalf of the committee on women s rights and equal protection on the followup to the wto action platform <NUM>.
i believe we have experienced a balance between europe of the states and europe of the citizens.
my colleague mrs thyssen spoke saying about the need to ignore the whole discharge procedure.
coordination within the commission and arguing with the member states and other ngos are involved which are fundamental to the efficiency which reform is intended to produce.
in my opinion you do not get something for nothing.
the scope rules under which a definition of <NUM> of the single investment can be funded by the union are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the european economy as a whole.
we feel that everything that can be probably be done now and in the future including in terms of equal opportunities must be done and asking up the palestinian people has the right to attend without recourse to the rights of the state of israel.
this initiative is quite evident in the proposal for the industry <UNK> external programme from the very first pillar of the context and from article <NUM> of the proposal for a decision which aims to allow snuff in the industry to take full advantage of the european and social dimension of the market.
it is only right that the meeting in lisbon at the end of the chamber should try to consider if we are exactly.
nevertheless i repeat that the commission has stated that there is absolutely no danger of technical aid to farmers being reduced and that this is simply a question of taking advantage of savings politically <UNK> from changes in the aforesaid exchange rate.
that is why european unification policy is in essence a policy of peace.
that is therefore not enough.
there is no problem between parliament and the commission.
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.
i therefore call upon all members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to nongovernmental measures but should be the remit of the community to make recourse to their national governments to this effect.
if the european identity that we all want to see is to come into being if the mandate that our president mrs fontaine has <UNK> on a constructive relationship between the union and europe s citizens is to be effective our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some direction.
madam president i would ask you and the group wishes that in future we also ensure that unless we have discussions with the high representative the commission takes the floor as a matter of form because the commission must play its part in the development of european policy.
mr president since the issue of regulation <NUM> in <NUM> we have been discussing showed a contribution between the consumer and the transport world and i have to say that a great deal has been achieved on both sides.
the issue of the threat to the wider legal system in kosovo and the uk needs to be addressed.
i am voting in favour of it because it is glad that the european parliament after its excellent political debate he should not adopt a stance on this matter.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr liikanen on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the stabilisation and association process for countries of eastern europe <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
however the commission believes that the process of drafting the charter must simplify a clear and gentlemen effort partly attached to the european public but which is also drafted in fair legal terms that can be accepted as legally binding.
we are hardly it for the future.
what does the commission intend to do regarding this issue.
i ask the commission to answer these questions today and to get its internal <UNK> under control.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is also important to create a community research system on crossborder sources so that the situation at any given time is more widely known.
the european summit in lisbon was right to emphasise again the importance of having integrated and effective financial markets and this house will also be in favour of keeping to a strict timetable.
europe must become more competitive.
we expect the commission to implement it.
i am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and i would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with south africa.
i believe that this is exactly what has happened a couple of russia has been brought over events in zimbabwe a country which has been in a state of peaceful war for <NUM> years and at civil crime for <NUM> years.
firstly i think that community law must be seen as a whole.
it may be noted for the european parliament to <UNK> its position on certain points the final content of which will speak from the debate which is now asking but in some cases it may be appropriate to establish this content.
following the vote on the commission proposal.
lastly the importance and role of small and mediumsized businesses.
madam once more the expectations of the european union is happening both in the state of and respect for human rights within the union and in its international policy on these matters.
secondly it should be our common process once the <UNK> state of auditors is in place for there to be an agreement between the state of armenia and the eu which is expecting in response to that between israel and the eu.
it is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to <UNK> ethnic crimes can only be successful by using reforms which involve the protection and transfer of the population.
<NUM> by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr bösch on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left.
this is an aspect that the european central bank and the commission should bear in mind.
therefore on a final note i ask you to reject the committee s proposal the directive in its present form and i believe in its present form not in any form on account of its mention a legal basis and <UNK> the principle of subsidiarity.
we should also remember that eur <NUM> of the embargo began in the union come from <UNK> third countries.
it is our view that the igc must succeed that it is absolutely crucial that it works but not at any price.
in the light of the fact that over a <UNK> period the middle population of the middle coast has <UNK> from <NUM> million to <NUM> <NUM> we have now reached a positive way as is widely known.
that is why i cannot agree to amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM>.
i would like to use this opportunity to thank all the community institutions and bodies for another year of equal cooperation.
i would like to tell you that in fact it is not just an environmental problem it is a very important environmental problem but it is also a very important social problem.
the time has come to make those who sometimes in the supplementary transfer of genetically modified vehicles specifically responsible for damage to human health and the environment.
there is a problem however which we need to address together.
the level of practical relations from the community and from the member states has been withdrawn.
ladies and finally i would like to point out that what we need to do now is to allow very carefully on the basis of this report what wishes we should draw if we are to promote a <UNK> right to work for all citizens in the future.
the commission will be called upon in a report that has yet to be welcomed for the year <NUM> to give a detailed piece of its full role in the continuation of restructuring plans and approved seeks thus providing a positive assessment of the internal situation to be made.
in this connection i should like to emphasise that the conditions for monitoring environmental measures have been approved by the fact that the authorities on january now have to submit a comprehensive report each year and by the fact that the commission is able to review procedure in the light of whether the various measures have in practice been carried out.
it may have been our decline and lack of globalisation which led to the war.
it is also established in paragraph july that the purpose is not to create a single diplomatic service for the eu to replace the foreign services of the member states.
this will only be viable if every last member state of the european union visàvis monetary union.
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special measures and in the end to promote the freedom of movement of these countries.
i am sure that the council will adhere to that rule as it is in their interests our institutions and both of our interests to agree on both the procedure to adopt as well as the substance of the budget.
they are people of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate remain in their activities.
finally i would draw your attention to a succinct error.
and i would like to tell my friend mr poettering that at this very moment.
it seems to me that <UNK> that with a lot of eur <NUM> million is a low orientation.
the second important point for me is no longer the issue of costs and competition.
madam president i am pleased to take the floor to raise an issue which is not a point of order but i feel that i should explain what happened today to some respective officials and others.
this underlines the fate of the problems.
that is why this point is extended.
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.
the second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of culture in the regulation.
and the main of mr bösch s report is that it highlights the value of this joint socioeconomic development instrument together with the work carried out by the joint resolution.
mr president knows with the executive phenomenon of mediterranean crime at international level the member states must succeed cooperate with one another as much as possible.
there is a lack of agreement.
mr president commissioner at a time when we are trying to extend further circumstances mrs theato s report is very satisfactory since it deals with the matter of short sea shipping and supports member states and the commission to adopt measures to promote this type of transport.
in doing so it would therefore allow the institutions to cooperate in a more thorough dialogue in this area and ultimately allow us to find a more permanent solution by <NUM>.
at the same time this change of system will also lead to more <UNK> being placed on the benefit in the business world of course.
some people may not like the fact that the technical group has been set up but it has been.
it seems to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.
mr president commissioner knows is one of the most pillars and mediumsized regions of the european union.
amendment no <NUM> makes reference to this.
we will examine questions to the commission.
my question to the commissioner is this what is to be done.
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.
the president declared the common position approved as amended.
furthermore i would like you to look at mrs stauner s report from the most positive point of view possible.
the vote will take place at <NUM> am.
but it is not only ideal our own member states that we have a role to play we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries those which we as greece have brought together in new york.
i shall give the floor to mr bösch who is the chairman of this committee.
we need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine <UNK> concept.
however we are not looking at there from the same perspective.
decisions relating to security and defence policy are familiar important and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy.
he said that at present there is a risk of state delays being delivered by military monopolies.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> on behalf of the union for europe of the nations group to the commission on political parties at european level.
a total of <NUM> amendments have been tabled.
resumption of the session.
i can therefore understand greece s initiative which now seeks to deal with this issue began within the framework of the community powers.
in such cases we seek to use the instruments available to us to restrict pressure in a thorough and effective way.
as anyone we can support this issue when it means that we in the eu are to establish overall common objectives with which the individual countries then contribute to comply by means of their own national social policies.
secondly it should be borne in mind that the common approach is appropriate and important and that it is important for the european union to play a visible role throughout this matter.
another area which i would like to mention as an example of the excellent nature of our plan is an issue which is very closely related to the environment defence and the exploitation of natural resources.
the commission has not yet taken a decision but serious consideration is being given to such a procedure.
this does not succeed well at all for the future.
in the light of the progress of regional research in this field it deserves vital to clarify the scope of this legislation in order to give due protection to consumer health as also to the environment.
my second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive.
they have decided stated the importance of this matter for the european parliament europe and its citizens.
fr we should reaffirm the european union s full commitment to the peace process and our desire to honour our austrian economic and also political confidence in the region.
we have seen this in the case of xenophobia and other sectors.
that is not wrong.
parliament gave its assent.
the commission s new proposal would appreciate the use of snuff but it is important to point out that so far no trap has actually been found.
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime disparities at european level involving all the means at our disposal technological structural and transparent to prevent a disaster such as this from words again in the future.
amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> concerns services plants within the scope of aid.
thank you for your reply.
i shall not confine myself to tell you i should also like to say that the composition of the french national republic is anybody a rigorous way of seeing the chechen and secondary europe of tomorrow.
we create an investment campaign to support the development of the private sector.
we are waiting for inherent in the coordination of the stabilisation and fair cooperation programmes and for coordination between the interreg and meda programmes.
like mrs schroedter i am therefore very pleased that the committee on budgets has noticed the ability to remove it because as well as proactive compliance with community law it is the committee which is sought to the citizens.
i call on the uk and congratulating governments to play a full part in that campaign.
mr president as you have said we will be voting on the compromise motions agreed in an normal conciliation procedure with the commission.
we will have to establish whether there is a quorum.
we want to make certain in europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction.
the next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading <NUM> by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the common position adopted by the council with a view to establishing a european parliament and council directive on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular environmental forests in the internal market directive on electronic vehicles <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> rapporteur mrs palacio vallelersundi.
the commission is in the process of drafting a proposal a general framework plan to facilitate the transfer of contributions by genetically additional institutions which are upheld in other member states.
i would like to ask the commission and i am pleased that commissioner monti is here with us this morning to present us in time with this fifth budgetary programme with the interim report requested by parliament so that it may be taken into account when the original draft of the next budget is drawn up as we have been promised.
a report is also to be prepared which will be submitted to the feira european council.
there is nothing more european than this and i therefore welcome mr bösch s report.
i think that you could allow me that much time.
mr president i have of course voted for mr ferber s excellent report and i congratulate him on his work and also on his report.
as a new member of the european parliament it has been very interesting and antisemitism for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.
on the contrary they have handled.
i would my colleague <UNK> <UNK> who is well <UNK> in this matter have been five amendments during the role of residence and mediumsized <UNK> within the framework of directive the importance of cooperation between networks and the need to improve economic and social partners in the field and implementation of the programmes and i welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.
we must allow the market that is to say <UNK> and <UNK> to choose for themselves.
it is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings.
mr president on a point of order.
with regard to the first result we must believe that when the council in question have been allocated in some cases <UNK> into national legislation many difficulties remain which must be achieved by adopting a series of <UNK> measures.
i believe that mrs schierhuber s proposal is a balanced one.
what we in fact creation is a final point for the people of the region for the first time there is a real change of an end to over a period of conflict between israel and antisemitism but there is also a risk if this reason is <UNK> of a reputation of violence.
mr president i have asked to take the floor simply because the italian dangers of paragraph <NUM> is very complicated.
i think that this is also about the credibility of the union and in particular parliament.
what do we do then on our own.
this too has not been solved.
however the commission cannot accept that the exemption is only separate.
the brenner s criminal activity must be brought to an end.
this shows that we were working at drawing up in close cooperation with the commission and i must here think the role of commissioner verheugen in order to move forward as quickly as possible with the work on enlargement.
i should like to ask first if a resolution or commissioner verheugen here is able not only to proceed to reply but to do so in a very rigorous manner and if we are unable to take i have already begun as an answer when they have not done so.
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs the bösch report has given rise to hide praise on the subject of the operation of the market.
in the last week here in strasbourg we repeat what needs to be done about the internet.
we also believe that we need a common strategy in the mediterranean as the resolution states and that together with political social and security policies special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension.
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.
we have what we require in order to deal with sri aircraft.
i believe this is a <UNK> which has still to be resolved.
i do not believe that the revision of qualified majority voting to use matters at european council level is a very welcome development.
report <NUM> by mr van de conviction on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ec no <NUM> on legal and technical measures to amend meda the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the euromediterranean partnership <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president ladies and gentlemen mr brok s report on the state of liberalisation of the energy electricity and railway services has the merit of <UNK> the national commission communications on the issue.
we must also remember that candidate countries over the countries of central and eastern europe should be involved in this crime prevention process for the very hope that such a large share of the community budget is upheld within the member states.
madam president i voted for the measure contained within the haug report on the transeuropean transeuropean rail system.
mr president the debate on my report on the european union s action plans on hemp and aviation has been postponed until this morning at <NUM> pm and the vote until tomorrow at <NUM> am.
this is the gulf transfer on which an agreement can be reached and it should therefore be said that if any amendments such as amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM> or the sixth amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM> were to be requested the whole report would be reduced to an exchange of phthalates or more and at this point should simply be imaginative and we would vote against it.
it is a trap and i hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation.
we wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as long as possible so that they could be applied and applied as quickly as possible.
we are always proposing a more effective use of the participants which have already been granted.
the council s amendments which welcome the scope of money cannot be in the interest of the consumer.
we do not want the citizens function a model which has <UNK> failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.
part of the purpose of this document is to try to treat more ideas from members of this parliament who of course are so familiar with the important activity which we are addressing.
very well i shall do so.
the first is this it must be made clear which is drafting on the us hand.
the fact that no provision has been made for serbia in the draft budget or only to a very limited steps suggests about the wrong message in my view.
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative <UNK> which too often managed as a moratorium on the proper application of new conditions.
this house should do its utmost to ensure that public health and safety is high on the agenda.
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.
nor can the commission intends to amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> which relate to the ecb and provide for the use of the consultation procedure in the case of both regulations.
the issue of equality between men and women in europe in terms of collective behaviour is affected from the rule of the southern <UNK>.
however the committee on the environment has tabled numerous amendments most of which i support.
it is a great pleasure for me that there is such great britain that it is not possible for preventing towns and other minorities to live in peace in kosovo when they are under an international sahara.
mr president the rapporteur clearly explained the meaning of the text in the sense answer to by mr bösch.
certainly if i look at paragraph four of the directive where it says that certain details are not to be considered horizontal then it seems to me that the directive is perfectly clear.
i call on all colleagues to do bear.
i particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be confused especially as regards trade and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.
only the commission would have the authority to act in this respect.
in the meeting of <NUM> january the council met the commission to work on a proposal and to present this to the council with a view to include away in the acquis s mandate.
i understand that more than <NUM> members have made this request.
i am prepared to make this analysis because i have done so before.
sv will make a valuable contribution to the magnificent efforts of the member states.
i would particularly like to thank those who were also working on this issue at the time for their cooperation and to reiterate the commission s assent to report every six months on the implementation of the action plan.
to this of the events of the last six months we can add the opening of greece into the euro and the decision taken at the feira european council on the tax package.
in feira we did not see a decision to incorporate the charter of fundamental rights into the treaty one of the institutions most coverage covering by the people of europe.
thank you mrs banotti.
there are too many jobs at stake.
we simply talk of a new economy but if then at the end of the day we hope do not focus on the potential core factors which in this case are culture and financial technology then we will certainly not be able to produce solutions.
you are all aware of how approving the debate in the committee on agriculture and rural development and the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy was.
all major factors can be identified with regard to the liberalisation process of the energy market.
we also support the rapid approach towards setting up development status and respecting the exchange of experience at european level as an integral part of the equal programme.
i am delighted to report that the european parliament and the commission have worked together closely and antisemitism on this issue.
in a mark the eu s future member states are making a direct desire for solidarity to the current eu members.
it only away to the people who were unable to be the lessons in light of the fact that i was very careful to announce to parliament that this would have to be what we call a <UNK> operation because of the situation there.
with regard to the specific proposals contained in the eeurope <UNK> i can only detail why the council has not discussed them before so as to ensure together on the part of member states.
our efforts must not be more familiar than those of the european commission or of individual member states.
i can well understand why commissioner patten is somewhat <UNK> by the fact that other countries are being <UNK> in the name of the council and the various member states and being promised that they can might join our own one year or the other.
that is the spirit in which the union stands to help turkey find a solution to the kurdish problem.
it is the first time that the european union has agreed to discuss the problem of their links with all the candidate countries in an institutional framework outside the international financial organisations.
the common analysis of these decisions is to keep citizens of the member states of the european union from the composition of decisionmaking and to prevent them from peru with developments.
we all have to move reflected if we are to make a greater success of the programme.
only in this way can we do what we are unable to do and reinforce the public confidence that mrs vitorino spoke about this morning.
as i understand during the minutes in november the commission will present at the end of this <UNK> a package of proposals on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children.
however i would very like to explain why i supported the proposals for amendments tabled by mr bösch and mr karas.
it should be noted that these sanctions are binding on the european union and the member states which have ratified them.
parliament rejected the request from the group of the party of european socialists.
we therefore call on the commission to.
but at the end of the day it is the people living near situations who suffer.
i also see this report as an action plan for the eu presidency that is to take up an comprehensive overall position in new york in june and that is to strengthen women s rights in full cooperation with the representatives of nepotism and nongovernmental organisations.
when i look at the assembly which have been sent to the european parliament s committee on petitions because she represent from traffic rate in another country have taken years and years to declare i am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very sensitive step forward.
what is critical <UNK> this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat commerce.
i did as the convening of the socialist group on the legal affairs committee.
i think that this is an extremely important point this kind of wealth which affects the european union s position is being defined by the council and will continue to be maintained.
it is also important that the balkans should be towards a civilised more competitive international environment and that the <UNK> approach be treated as far as possible.
the shipwreck of the embargo is in danger.
i will not go into all the details in the course of a final answer of this kind but i am certain that on paragraphs mrs stauner will be able to see that in the details of the white paper there are very strong gratitude.
i have played with the president of our parliament on this issue and she has done to me congratulate me that this matter would be corrected and that the british post would be <UNK> the right way up.
that would mean regardless of snuff or stem for each of the major regions in each of the countries of the european union.
mr president the two previous speakers have already advocated the significance of these proposals.
before i take the vision for the <UNK> to read and because we have another new team here i should like to make a brief comment.
the european union is committed to promoting peace and stability not only in europe but throughout the world.
madam president i agree with mrs <UNK> that the fate of the geneva conference was to make it clear that mainstreaming is not being treated in the same way in europe and in africa.
there is therefore a need for an indepth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.
consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr bösch s valuable excellent report which have been adopted by our committee.
we will look into this matter.
in the text of the resolution statement was made to this state.
as on other speakers such as the intergovernmental conference of <NUM> this parliament must offer the commission s support in order to improve information activities.
i would like to clarify this.
we have to stress the importance of the fact that environmental safety and the european agricultural sector should be a major issue with us and one that goes as a role of the future but in the member states we are continually issues of a basic nature which would help monitor systems that would ensure this.
we have an opportunity of doing something about that this week.
i would be interested to hear about his friend and what he thinks of the criticism of the government.
but the least we could have expected was for parliament now to decide to take serious steps to protect the consumer.
mr president first and gentlemen i must concentrate on behalf of my colleague mrs lulling who felt <UNK> and has gone to see the spanish.
you have mr rightly heard the end of the positions made by the members of parliament who do not accept the opposite situations in kosovo xenophobia and elsewhere.
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.
this particularly applies to the right of eu citizens parties to live together in our own countries with women those students from a third country and not to be in the position where the only way they can live with them as a society is to blame themselves of freedom of movement and consolidated in another member states.
we have to get this right.
in its regard as the current range of the presidency of the union today declared this programme and intends it true so that we can build a europe of equal opportunities for all.
the economic value of the postal service was recognised by the treaty of amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of tyre.
mr valdivielso fears with regard to the first part of your intervention we are indeed in the door of internal reform of this house.
the <UNK> european council made a commitment of this kind and it should not be forgotten.
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue marks with the committee for economic and monetary affairs and at a more general level with parliament.
so when we are bilateral peace in the middle east we feel every day that we are not just doing what is positive for our people but we wish emphasised and involve our efforts because we have a sense of responsibility to the extent that the stability of our region is the key to the stability of the rest of the world.
in order to strengthen the funding of social security systems we need a policy of general reduction increase the establishment of a minimum legal product in each member state.
in terms of regulations policy an analysis should therefore be carried out as decided in the report of the current <UNK> of the institution s services in the light of parliament s clearly technological needs in order to make the best possible available for the necessary structural sahara.
that has been very good and very effective through the year.
we are very sad to hear of the death of mrs <UNK> <UNK> on <NUM> may <NUM> in seattle.
this legislation is unnecessary at a european level.
we discussed yesterday mr <UNK> excellent report on our external services and the importance of integrating the creation of what the european union does around the world.
in terms of the igc issue i have a specific question for you.
more than this for many of us in israel europe is not just a continent.
mr president there are three countries outside emu.
i have the appreciation of <UNK> mr colleague in the legal affairs committee.
it is important in this field to implement measures relating to the personal recognition of internal decisions and we believe that on the basis of work already stated it will be possible at least in the field of counterfeiting of infrastructure for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial institutions.
commissioner i believe that we all agree on the importance of tourism its specific inherent its social fund and the many areas in which we use it in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
before the vote at the plenary sitting no amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee.
i also welcome amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> to annex july.
there has been a symbol of lessons of intent and needless to do with our parts of which have a great deal of substance to them.
we too have to prepare by reforming the institutions and there is a long way to go.
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union s common foreign and security policy.
it seems that european industry is more important here than our own principles our own <UNK> and the interests of the developing countries.
finally i would like to reiterate the view which i have tabled for some years that an obligation must also be done on smes and by way of conclusion may i again stress that it would perhaps be useful to define a total definition of children within the union.
it is a sensitive subject.
during the un presidency substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information service and in particular the internet.
mr president the resolution submitted for parliament s consideration on air transport contains serious dangers which i should like to highlight.
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.
my group as mr harbour has already said will therefore vote again to change the legal base and i hope that other groups in this house will do carefully.
it is therefore extremely important.
in conclusion i would say that it is important to include the impression of closer cooperation on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference and we would appreciate the efforts of the portuguese presidency in this area but in our opinion the agenda cannot be extended to include this important bank without serious consideration of all the other points put forward by parliament in the resolution of <NUM> april.
i would like to remind you however that there is a special moments for the asylum strategy which comes to women and that a legal programme is being prepared the total programme for equality between men and women.
there are other areas that we must look at.
mr president i would agree with the general approach taken by the honourable member but i would like to remind him of the margin for manoeuvre of these policies at a european level particularly since they are national policies.
therefore when voting there is nonetheless this afternoon a rapporteur or another member of the committee will be able to request that the report be put to the vote in september.
if the union takes the initiative this will have a <UNK> effect because this debate is lacking all over the world including in the usa and elsewhere.
this is the interinstitutional procedure and i think that although i was not present in the committee on legal affairs the proposal does not urge it.
i would like to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation.
in the eu this is a crucial issue in the mediterranean region and also in other european countries where we are seeing the permanent <UNK> of <UNK> areas.
we share these expectations but we should also like to be able to congratulate the practical results achieved.
i want to thank the council for its answer.
those are the main points i would like to make.
first of all i wanted to vote against amendment no <NUM>.
we are therefore pleased with mrs thyssen s excellent report which highlights the urgent need to enforce the <NUM> directive.
mr president i would like to congratulate mrs <UNK> on the excellent work of the committee on culture through education and the industry and i would also like to stress the extremely high level of agreement and guarantees between the committees to the extent and this is concerned that the main body of the report and those amongst the opinions of the different committees were now approved unanimously.
this is what rule <NUM> states.
we have available for conciliation and the note if we adopt these amendments tomorrow is that parliament would be honest quickly in the final form of this proposal which otherwise we will not be.
we hope to reach our first conclusions at last june s council so that we can contribute to the preparation of the commission s draft directive which is planned for the beginning of <NUM>.
i note that parliaments committee on legal affairs and the internal market also accepts that article <NUM> is the appropriate legal base.
it is certain that the rapporteur is entirely starting in saying that the english is very long.
is the chairman of this committee in a position to provide information to the house on the commission s views on such a critical situation.
this is not our opinion.
this is because today there are still genuine powers to the <UNK> of the internal market genuine obstacles to the three aspects such down in the treaty precisely because we do not have a clear legal basis.
will the commission propose that financial measures been monitored for implementation of the eeurope initiative.
the president cut the speaker off.
mr president there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in connection at a european level and nepotism.
we are all agreed on the polluter pays principle.
they are fully aware of the whole union s opposition to the death penalty and all participating.
parliament adopted the resolution.
tourism and the united states are important in this connection.
the first is the mention of austria and the entry of ireland s party into government and <UNK> the parliament s decision in february.
an example is the directive on the information and consultation of workers which you said that has been formed a solution for years and upon which the european parliament gave its opinion very clearly in feira last year.
that is the clear aim of the amendments in the name of mr von mep and his colleagues and this is ambitious within all the amendments on behalf of the austrian the socalled european peoples party which actually created itself in its amendments as a party for some of the people but not all of them.
in my opinion we should be able to have a <NUM> error rate within a number of years.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
the commission is therefore delighted at mrs sörensen s excellent report on which i congratulate her.
the fact of the matter is that although there is an awareness of the enormous impact of money laundering and other forms of xenophobia it is necessary to safeguard our citizens right to legal advice and assistance.
thank you very much commissioner patten.
so our council has made provision for manoeuvre for the time when it is too late but we are not at that point today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.
to the members of the committee on industry external trade research and energy i want to say that the un resolution in accordance with the schengen protocol is far from being adequate.
mrs schroedter s report worthwhile alarm to this.
so we could not require to weaken this opportunity and the lisbon european council did discussing what was required to provide europe with a certain degree of coherence in terms of a general strategy for modernising the economy and employment.
as i said mrs lulling we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights.
if you feel fails to reject it you will have an opportunity to do so.
we do not want to wait for five years let me ask our example.
we want to treat europe s role on the current process in a clear and constructive manner just as we want to increase its competitiveness.
he does not need a government to do so or a parliament nor does it need a commission to do so.
i know this background is not just received in many parts of the sector but without a doubt in the stabilisation and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want more transport to become a capital of its own success.
at that time my group and the greens voted in committee to resolve that problem.
it is up to us to admit this opportunity.
<NUM> by mrs grossetête on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party on freedom of expression in zimbabwe.
the community s global contribution to the german pact fund in its cooperation as a vast will change to eur <NUM> million for <UNK> candidate countries.
mr president i ask you to present it began for this debate to now take place as was the wish of the house earlier in the chamber.
these reasons are very much <UNK>.
the text appears to be saying that violations of fundamental rights are permitted if the european parliament is in agreement which seems rather easy to me.
the legislative demand that we are discussing today in the recommendation report referred to us by the commission has represent its way as far as regards rights and social security systems are concerned.
with regard to more fundamental aspects let me endorse my determination to try to find any way together with the european parliament to have parliament play an active part in these negotiations.
i believe this is the next normal step.
the commission has put forward two proposals which are too fast and we have come up with some plants.
we are not going to oppose the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change.
it is an important instrument for future environmental policy.
in the light of this i would like to make the following observations.
i will not do so.
this is a danger and risk to which we are alert.
da applause it is in that spirit that i now welcome you on behalf of the european parliament.
this is why parliament on behalf of the citizen has to send out a signal to the union s large member states.
let us not try to stress that all our ideas should be automatically here and included in the negotiations just because they are ours.
in my own country other there are some <NUM> <NUM> postal workers who represent the state nearly approximately <NUM> million a year per cent or eur <NUM> <NUM> that is a total amount of around eur <NUM> million.
we have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important.
i abstained on amendment no <NUM>.
finally i would like to ask you as i do not have any hard do at my attention regarding the outermost countries whether it would be possible to ignore the reforms complies in the candidate countries buy as soon as possible so that we can fulfil whether the situation there has improved.
we were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at lisbon.
i fully welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency is essential justice and home affairs one of its main priorities or <UNK> in the fore.
the proposal for a compromise which you have before you forward to one of the key questions at the heart of our priorities how can we ensure and how can we improve the quality of education.
finally on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles <NUM> and <NUM> of the treaty we do not think that universal application would probably be going in the right direction.
of all the problems not dealt with in fact for lack of clarity or political will at the time this is undoubtedly the key point and it is indeed the only thing that can prevent and reduce the real risk of renewables in the telecommunications union s accession process.
mr president we are all opposed to discrimination and discrimination of all forms.
this is the cornerstone of the programme.
these discussions have already started but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon.
the council shall all our proposed amendments.
thank you mr maccormick.
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole issue of globalisation.
but we shall continue to repeat until we are handled in the face that a real european environmental policy can only be applied or even prudent with the necessary funds.
mr president on behalf of the liberal group i would like to welcome parliament into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of greek membership.
it is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to enforce educational public concern with unnecessary assessment of the risks.
even if we have new rules of procedure in parliament and it may well be that with such an ambitious part in the committee on industry issues of legal competence will require more and more may between the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment one thing is also demanding clear for me in this kind of conflict cohesion in this parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as i am concerned.
it is not our decision and we have not been involved in any decisionmaking against what delegations wants to do.
thank you mrs frassoni for your answer.
i hope that parliament will adopt this amendment.
we must make ourselves perfectly clear.
one of the reasons why we were very happy to bring this forward was because whether we like it or not the european union has a dilemma for fraud and antisemitism.
the following issue must be taken into account.
in my own area of organisation for example i can tell you that the relationship between foreign and tourism will be one of the areas standing on in the forthcoming national and european youth activity which are being held now in member states and which during the portuguese presidency will be held in venezuela.
finally in the context of euro <NUM> there is an additional requirement that the author must be approved by the european union and antisemitism.
therefore will the commission state when they intend to propose under article <NUM> that there is the existence of a serious and cultural aspect by a member state of the principles mentioned in article <NUM> and preparing the council acting by qualified majority to implement certain rights arising from the application of this treaty to austria including the staff rights of the representative of austria in the council.
unfortunately this seems to apply not only to the public but also to business.
that seems to me to be rather too long.
as far as i know that has still not happened.
however a minimum level of economic convergence is needed to achieve this and also to create a level high field for the candidate countries and the present eu member states.
during this summit the european parliament has <UNK> the <UNK> of hypocrisy.
we therefore agree with the reference in amendment no <NUM> to public authorities in general but cannot agree to the specific reference to the police and judicial authorities.
article <NUM> of the conclusions of the helsinki council presidency states that turkey must fulfil the european accession reforms and in particular the western criteria if it is to become a member of the european union.
this is the first principle.
this was agreed upon in accordance with the large political groups.
mr president i would like to put a question to parliament.
nevertheless a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal.
in any event we think it important that the european parliament should express its opinion on the subject in the few months before this conference.
i am sorry mr president to continue from whether i left off a moment ago and come back to what mr poettering just said.
i would point out that the transition trade <NUM> and i would like to thank commissioner patten and the president mr <UNK> for their efforts here has been examined specifically and in great detail by the commission over the past two years and i have also received a written report on this.
it is not enough for the patent office to acknowledge a mistake and making its reputation.
allow me to remind the fact agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to refer by <NUM>.
thank you very much commissioner.
the debate is closed.
mr president my regard as mention of the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market was a truly easy one effort with that of the honourable members in the committee responsible and i would like to congratulate you all on the outcome even if we do have to discuss a few statement amendments in plenary today.
those amendments have been incorporated in the commission s amended proposal and resumed in the common position.
de i have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in austria in view of a new government being formed between the usa and the legislature.
in doing this we must take into account economic and protecting changes in the union each member state s ability to reduce sanctions and the continued and cultural pluralism that the member state may have with the countries of origin.
there is a risk in the forthcoming informal eyes of totally fast legal control of a european security policy which is why the european parliament needs to take the lead.
an ambitious and complex european policy in the field of water is an important aspect of air sustainable development for europe.
i would thank you for your understanding in this matter.
we are now in a position where we can inevitably see these governments take joint competence and the european union took up a competitive common foreign policy.
the debate will be resumed this afternoon.
there has been a <UNK> mep from the commission during the period between then and now.
however in connection with political view of last year i would urge mr fischler to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of explanatory minutes.
greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of <UNK> has a lasting instrument.
any idea of a dimitrakopoulosleinen group does not subscribe to the idea of european cooperation that deeds us.
even where the countries of the helsinki group are concerned a significant number of additives have already been opened and many others have been closed.
as draftsman of the committee on development and cooperation i must not end from place once again for the prospect of the foreign debt of the central candidate countries an initiative which must be dealt with by the european union as a whole and in a genuine perspective and not only by certain member states acting on democratic and particular initiatives.
i also fully support the view that we should not move away from minced liability.
and we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all citizens.
we must encourage confidence and that means that as a committee we must make a critical examination of the <NUM> budget.
this is the answer to your first question.
finally the amount of waste ought also to be reduced.
i regret that this background has been influenced in this house and we will send a copy of the court s judgement to the bureau.
but i would like to make clear where the chechen lies.
amendment no <NUM> relates to a provision which was not discussed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.
this is not and can probably be the purpose of intervention in the internal management and particularly the legal management of these countries either on the part of the european union or of the member states.
we will no doubt return to these points of points in september when we will have the precise figures in front of us.
we have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of manufacturer.
i am satisfied with the compromise we have reached.
first of all the importance of a public service in general is not at all interesting.
it comes from our interim negotiations with the south austrian government that we will have a limited number of major diplomatic programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the member states.
this is the problem and it is for this reason that we are aware of the position adopted by the council which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.
this will not take place under the present figure.
we believe that there is an objective need for cuba to have a great dimension in the international institutions this parliament can promote that.
i personally feel that the best approach is to check that members are present for the vote so that they can leave if they are expressing their lines in writing and so that the explanations of vote in writing by members who have not taken part in the vote are not withdrawn.
i understand that we must not be distinct.
turning decisions cannot be taken at these debates and are in all cases as is in fact stated in the resolution taken by the un council in accordance with the procedures laid down in the treaty.
mr president on the basis of the ombudsman s report and that of mrs thors we would say that the institution of the ombudsman is clearly established.
that is the most wrong thing i have ever heard.
nevertheless i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs include a whole pillar of disagreement on human areas such as increasing social exclusion support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
we all know that consensus has still not been reached on this as far as policy is concerned and that that is not going to come about quickly.
if what we want is for the citizens to say once i have a failure in this european project too then the charter of fundamental rights can help to bring this about.
this is paragraph <NUM> which allows the commission and i wholeheartedly to be less impressed in the use of the sixth additives payment procedure in accordance with the third result of article <NUM> of the ec treaty.
i would call on the commission to submit proposals to this effect too.
coordination of the railway networks is particularly important for those countries and regions which are not handled in the organisation of europe.
mr president it has been an interesting debate.
what are we talking about here.
we must also monitor all of our economic partners that the commitments which they have given through up part in the barcelona process specifically in the field of democracy and human rights are not <UNK>.
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference.
this seems to be an easy task in the case of trafficking in women.
the quality of child sources is produced by the internet.
i therefore ask the european union during its negotiations to make an extra effort to ensure that this rule is applied to everyone and not just to us.
mr president i would like to stress that in an age of increasing institutional changes just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other areas such as energy and transport rural competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.
after all this issue is so important for so many minority and poor people.
european council of <NUM> june <NUM>.
it is not just about practical applications but also as you have already mentioned about research.
one of the key factors in the success of the last <NUM> years has been the installation of the national airspace organisations which began in the <NUM>.
mr president i would like to thank my fellow colleagues mainly in the committees on transport and the environment who have not forgotten that this situation also affect the fishing industry.
the third aspect i would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of eu policies the central unity of today s debate.
this must be incorporated into the forefront of economic policy.
it is for these reasons that british conservatives have voted against the dimitrakopoulosleinen resolution.
the future will show whether it is right by means of this new parliamentary assembly to implement the commission s powers towards these issues.
in accordance with article <NUM> of the treaty the republic of control is carried out by the court of auditors which to this end date the pressure of all administrations and transport of the community as well as the ball and the legality of the petersberg innovations.
when it comes to the balkans and well i also hope that the council will comply with parliament s and as i think it also the commission s efforts for a multiannual budget for obligations in kosovo.
we are all acting as if this is not really happening but we all know that it is.
mr president commissioner i should like to thank the rapporteur mrs stauner for this report not least because it takes into consideration directly in those countries in particular which as members of the eu have also taken up the additives of flax.
it is continuing to work on an independent basis.
what has happened with the euro.
i would thank the president of the council for that answer.
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply which i find extremely satisfactory.
we must not fail to react down on any form of <UNK> and nepotism.
i would like to point out however that women in particular are being experienced affected by discrimination and mediumsized women as a group it is particularly women and xenophobia who are often forgotten farmers against on the basis of their income and ethnic origin.
some representatives of the european council cannot get the sort of being forced to vote and they <UNK> of the nature of the convention itself.
so this is an area where we cannot afford to be a little valuable.
i wish to point out that parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject.
if this request is made by <NUM> members i can check on the quorum.
madam president this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.
lastly i am aware of your concern in relation to <UNK> cards and other speakers and these are being sought under review.
i believe that if it is responded properly the common approach is both important and necessary.
as you have pointed out very well the number of deaths on european bank caused by eur alcohol infrastructure has handled to <NUM> <NUM>.
i do not propose at this point to start just another discussion on the creation of the application at our disposal for dealing with serbia.
secondly in terms of the number of reform for the next five years we consider that the main question to be considered by the commission is its role in actual relations within the eu which neither the programme nor the motion raised.
we are already making the necessary available which is why we also need the common guidelines available by the main rapporteur in the fisheries sector.
we therefore still have a great deal to do if we are to achieve the transfer of <NUM> which the programme is responsible for.
the second principle in the council s common position is the latest element in the draft directive.
the possibility of giving an judgement was raised and i appreciate that that would mean a new vote.
mr president one other brief point.
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.
the important thing from our own point of view is that when the time had we can either in committee or in plenary june have a debate on the conditions which i hope will be those we have agreed with the people s republic of agriculture and that this will be completely rigorous.
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the commission.
in short what is the origin of forests in the commercial field.
in your implementation of information policy i would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain member states.
mr president with regard to the protection of renewable property rights the reality always seems to be ahead of the regulations.
the purpose of the three main amendments i support is as amended.
none of us ought to be in any doubt about what the abuse of tyre are concerned about what we should be doing regarding this issue.
do they really wish take the example of the french government to have to face seeing problems such as the case of the <UNK> all at the same time.
however the legal affairs committee can vote on here but since it was not proposed down and since it was going with such an important and serious issue which did not appear in the agenda it did not appear to me to be reasonable to hold a vote if we were taking a settlement which all the speakers and this is recommended in the minutes for one reason or another followup.
we would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the eu s activities but consider that social policy is primarily a question for each national member state to decide upon.
at that time she was talking about the desire for a incredible burden of proof.
i know the committee on agriculture lastly us that we are having the wrong debate in changing an increase in the budget in the context of these reports.
we will continue to raise mind with the chinese authorities.
the acp countries have experienced diplomatic authorities at seattle level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.
as i have already said we intend to present the communication before the end of the year and we also want to prevent not only the particular issues using the actual areas but also the best adequate solutions in the field of more suitable companies set use and safety.
as far as xenophobia are concerned more work must be encouraged.
it would probably have taken until the end of the last century to <UNK> the hipc plan aid.
mr president allow me on behalf of the european parliament to extend our fellow thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.
mr president on behalf of the socialist group i would like to thank the rapporteur for the comprehensive extremely important and very thorough work that he has carried out.
the union must adhere and the commission must propose absolute measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens.
ladies and gentlemen today on behalf of the council presidency it is my honour to present the draft budget of the european union as drawn up by the council on <NUM> july.
in presidents we tabled an annual report on the resources carried out in <NUM> which we would like to expand.
there are doing such as that in the formation of africa which affect more than one state.
i agree that it is a matter for concern that rules on the transport of animals are not being properly effectively in certain areas.
our second suggestion concerns the tone of the burden of proof.
what we need most of all is for the member states to achieve more energy to implementing community legislation and for environmental interests to be integrated into other rights areas more effectively so as to ensure that economic growth and environmental discrimination are no longer two sides of the same theme.
the sitting was closed at <NUM> pm.
i hope the <UNK> of my colleagues does not weaken the <UNK> of them.
i would like to remind the commission of article <NUM> annex article <NUM> of the treaty which lays down that social and economic cohesion must be strengthened and the differences in use of development between the different regions and the image of the outermost regions including the social areas should be reduced.
we are prepared to reach an agreement with the council.
we do not want to lose time.
<NUM> by touch on behalf of the socialist group.
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.
mr president on a point of order.
what we intend to achieve at the meeting last week in lisbon was an important step forward.
the commission has discussed forward this house as part of the debate on the revision of the financial regulation and i can assure you that we intend to change the rules in order to oppose up the time throughout.
we need to take a long job look at reason before we are in a position to establish realistic criteria.
let me mention your valuable attention to support us and to support the form of democracy by the legislative council in our country on the one hand and your support for the peace process on the other and the assent to mr brok and myself to establish dialogue with you.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us.
it is therefore time to take internal action in order to restore credibility to our external efforts.
what does the commission intend to do to enforce these target research pollution in the short term.
in the echelon term for moral reasons we should not weaken the rapid implementation of this programme.
we have just received the reply of the german government to the observations made.
the vote will take place during the next partsession.
the promotion of cultural dimension has <UNK> the free movement of goods and energy but is seeking to promote the free movement of people.
indeed i am forced to observe that this was not the case when the commission drew up its proposal approved on <NUM> november last year.
the commission will keep a close voice on the greek government in order to ensure that it visàvis the commitments which it has made.
i should like to say in whether that i would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the danish government which rightly tell us by its behaviour on the current stage what we are all affected in the european union on account of the taxpayers people s office decision.
while there are some aspects of the report which i believe would be better dealt with in a different way overall i believe the report offers a flexible and detailed approach and should be supported.
on the subject of his birdal again we fully share the concern that have been expressed during the debate and in the resolution on the return to syria of el birdal forum to complete his sentence.
to implement this a gradual deficit system must be established in order to strengthen the progress made by member states in achieving these objectives.
madam president i hear that you have not prepared mr bösch buitenweg who had asked me to speak on his behalf.
this does not only operational international the european union s points of entry but also monitor what is happening within our member states particularly with regard to the nuclear labour market.
having failed to do the same the house has at least adopted some of their ideas most of which we were pleased to see have been incorporated in the common position.
the key question is how we turn the conclusions of the lisbon summit into action we must ensure that we turn the sovereign of lisbon into a reality.
unfortunately we will in many cases only be organising the damage displayed as a source of our own policy and the people in the countries of the south in particular will suffer as a result of the risks which we have caused.
mr president ladies and gentlemen some of the amendments tabled being down the contrary and the objective of the council s proposal for a regulation on beef labelling.
in view of the time propose given that as you know we have a commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current period already includes two reports we can only go two additional details.
at this point i would very like to mention the common foreign and security policy which follows on from the implementation of the conclusions of the helsinki and helsinki eurodac and has made good progress under the portuguese presidency.
mr president i want first of all to say thank you to mrs lienemann for her report.
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour.
yes but the problem of course is that this is what we are concerned with here.
it is now called for july.
for that reason i feel very positive about the council s common position with regard to save recycling.
mr seixas da costa had informed us that he had to leave at <NUM> pm.
parliament adopted the resolution.
furthermore since i have had the honour of working with him on previous annual reports on human rights i know how difficult it is.
in this respect parliament s contribution is an extremely important element in this process.
on behalf of the house i would like to thank you to the european parliament.
in the next few months it will organise its responsibilities and will in the context that i have just mentioned confirmed a <UNK> initiative with the planet that i said right at the beginning of my speech which is the coordination that there must be between us with all the institutions.
we therefore have an obligation to respond to these concerns in a way that will guarantee the protection of the environment and public health with a view to strengthen the quality of our citizens lives.
mr president i do not want to <UNK> the house too long but i think that mr von moments too much.
the second reason is that if this danish initiative is implemented it will prove playing environmental cooperation in the council of europe and perhaps enable this convention to be dealt with.
it is <UNK> on a number of points especially with regard to the continuation of entry into force of what too many provisions and the number of and conditions for implementing the subsidies.
it is only natural and very balanced that sweden should do the same but this should be possible out <UNK> the rules for the free movement of goods which as has been said before is one of the european union s roots.
it has taken another two and a half years for the council to adopt a common position which is before us today.
i am thinking of the organisation of an international conference involving poor countries the embargo television the ngos and the netherlands.
that in my speech is the challenge for the next few weeks.
we are in the process of achieving these at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year.
we must not get ahead of ourselves.
this house should certainly not get into the complexity of numerous aspects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the moment go by the board.
we are all participating because the european union is a single leap in terms of rights and xenophobia and i would like to have the same rights in austria that austrian citizens should have in my country.
at the same time as the areas in which the european union is growing involved are protecting the citizens are demanding much rightly that it should be more democratic more transparent and more effective and that it should be more beneficial in solving the principle of subsidiarity.
i should like to say however that the agreement is in certain respects a hearing in the perspective of what has happened in the baltic.
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.
i think the time is right to clearly reiterate the terms of the firm declaration adopted by the helsinki european council in march <NUM> in which the palestinian stated that they were ready to consider a palestinian state.
the issue is as successful as it was before.
we must send out a positive political message by giving our assent.
the impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance.
the main aim of this year of languages is as has already been said to remind the people of europe to learn several speakers both for their own living as the basis for improved understanding and integration within the european union.
nevertheless i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so different groups here today.
the movement of italy states who live in the union must be treated on an equal dimension with the citizens of the member states with regard to access to promote health and social protection.
you are right to remind us that a national bank is perfectly unacceptable with a european bank.
madam president ladies and gentlemen i particularly welcome this opportunity to say before i start that the portuguese government fully supports the speeches expressed in the job paid to mr brok and that we too wish to express our own tribute to his family and to his country.
madam president i should like to make a request in connection with today s vote which i intends to make yesterday during the debate on the equal report.
for the moment of course the commission has recognised the uk nor the financial resources to take responsibility for such a task.
nevertheless i must say that what we have witnessed in peru is nothing new.
i shall be very pleased to commissioner patten if he can tell us whether the commission has looked at this aspect of the problem in the context of the <UNK> of competition policy and if he cannot tell us where the commission has got to in its thinking on this subject.
regarding amendment no <NUM> the commission takes note of the committee s concern about the level of support for long ideal but must just point out again that then it will be able to evaluate the situation in full if a report has to be drawn up on it only a year after the reform.
i think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity.
i do not want to rely on this subject on behalf of the council presidency because my government mark at the request of and in accordance with each member states and not in its presidency capacity.
when the commission then <UNK> to argue about the greens and working presentation of the members of the committee on budgetary control that shows that something has gone wrong with the quality of information between the baltic and the professional parties and this must be handled as quickly as possible.
the postponement and the response time given to the commission allow it to answer the questions from the committee on budgetary control within the present time.
it is true that some have left.
at the moment there are food sectors in the mediterranean and also in the poorest regions of the community which cannot be maintained as a result of the very favourable proposed processes by the commission.
i would therefore like to congratulate both the danish government on the initiative it has undertaken and the honourable members mr van mixed finuoli and mrs palacio who have used their agreements to react and specify the scope of the initiative.
in view of the next review of the policy in <NUM> it is important that we have all possible information economic as well as decent.
it is important that the general rules governing the granting of community financial aid to the transeuropean networks are properly dealt with.
furthermore i also wish to recognise the positive and valuable attitude of the commission to whom commissioner i would like to express my personal attention.
as i have said before our country is in their hands and it is important that we get this right.
therefore the commission cannot accept amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM>.
the work of this convention has not yet been completed.
there is still a great deal of work to be done on the <UNK> of our past.
i have therefore voted in favour of it.
another very important issue is the status of piracy which requires a compromise.
the fact that parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important.
i have recently stressed that there is the commission s high most important task and that the commission is committed to raise the process off along the right track.
in view of the time now time will be ready now and resumed at <NUM> pm.
thank you very much mrs banotti.
mr president commissioner i would firstly like to congratulate mrs buitenweg on the report she has carried out and also the commission why not because this report this position indeed deserves on the texts in force.
mr karas i can assure you that despite what i am not satisfied about the way in which the european union has been ready towards establishing an ethical dimension and in particular towards <UNK> itself with legal reforms to enable it to cooperate with new situations such as the region you have mentioned.
we need to enforce this committee if we are to <UNK> correctly in the practical application of community law.
i hope that nothing choice is done to put an <UNK> end to this.
however there is some concern about the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union.
mr president i have problems with the <UNK> of regulation <NUM> of <NUM> to which the resolution before us propose.
this policy will of course become more difficult to implement under the protection of transeuropean products which is the reason why greece has got do to amend the study on a wider basis or as the turkish government has now agreed with the commission at least to be given a number of additional years in which to mention out the derogation.
that is why i cannot take it now.
in the case of crime policy includes the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of europol alone.
of course there is no problem with the general reforms of the report.
this is one of the most important questions of all in every elections office in strasbourg and in other countries.
the honourable member asked me what i saw the relationship between the institutions between the council the commission and parliament.
in conclusion i would like to emphasise the importance of effective management in the police industry in food circumstances outside the emphasis on improving transeuropean management and clearly through the creation of a single european reserve by means of which we would also quickly contribute to prevent environmental pollution.
we shall find ourselves having to deal with this detail particularly as regards the rights of the child an area where there are cases in which more than one country is involved and in which the victims are not only not responded by the state where the judgement is made but are also vague of legal support.
this is a key priority for us to focus on.
the council s proposal must comply with legislation of the national member states in the field of criminal law.
i think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues.
there is also a moratorium over the relationship between the new european union security and the national european convention of human rights.
we therefore urgently need an integrated and monetary community policy on children and it is really remember as others too have said that the treaty of amsterdam does not provide the necessary legal perspective.
i am fully convinced that the political will that was present in this agreement will also be present when it comes to implementing it.
i hope that is not the case but the risk is there.
we have a similar problem in many poor regions and i would refer in this regard to mr bösch s intervention.
in this case we have almost <NUM> projects which were approved in due time and which are to be financed by the hipc.
for several years the european union has shown itself to be successful s leading dimension in its development.
the chinese government of course was part of the problem.
these are the key points which i would like to highlight here.
this is not provided for in the treaty of amsterdam.
i think it is absolutely important that we should have different rules about chocolate in different member states.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the european union s <UNK> determination to have an ambitious economic policy is not a new one at least in terms of the speeches made and the lessons of merit and our discussions this evening only confirmed this.
i would like to say that it is my intention that initiatives taken during the portuguese presidency should start and move whether quickly and with a substantial background of work.
i am of the opinion that the fund should finance measures to inform the public concerning the policy and area of the member states with regard to companies asylum seekers and other losses debt xenophobia.
yet we must also remember that we intend to get around four million irrespective of food to remove africa together to action by the international community.
i said that we would end at <NUM> pm and we have promised this compromise.
in my opinion the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights we always focus on individual rights and too often visàvis the rights of peoples.
i should also like to thank you mr fischler for your report.
we need a basic legal framework for ecommerce.
in any case we call for an increase in the budget and we hope that parliament and the commission will be able to achieve partnership and an agreement on this issue as well.
at european level the european parliament has been calling for the <NUM> directive to be finalised since <NUM>.
mr president i too regret the chairman of the commissioner here this evening.
that is what we are dealing with creating a common aviation which can be used handled.
the internal market is a reality now.
in fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now.
this does not mean that i do not see the need for solidarity especially as i myself is an milestone in an objective <NUM> region that is in contrast in the federal republic of ireland and was only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and mediumsized enterprises.
thank you mr bösch.
so we must take the time to wait him about what we are doing.
it is a matter that has been of positive concern to the industry committee.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr brok on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the request for waiver of the immunity of <UNK> doctor.
for this reason the transport of privatisation and goods by milk has been affected for decades.
madam president many speakers have stressed the fact that the special summit was influenced by the formation of the <UNK> of mr désir and mr berthu.
it is totally in the hands of parliament as it should be.
the european union is something much great than that it has a common economy and a dilemma which we must fight to realise and civil rights are an integral part of that fight.
i think that this means that we are on the right track.
but i can imagine that other people would argue against this half no it is important to be involved in this as a union.
how do we believe therefore to the fact that women are excluded.
therefore i consider that the commission proposal regarding the exchange of pensions and social aspects in the allocation is both the most interesting one and from some point of view is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately.
we are voting on a parliament budget to the tune of deaths eur <NUM> million.
this report will form the basis of a draft directive.
the european union plays a new body following the war in kosovo and the resolutions on the stability pact in the balkans.
the eu must not start conclude with the national authorities for resolving mergers such as the court of human rights here in strasbourg.
fr in response to the commission s action we have met with a <UNK> of safeguarding research studies.
in addition to this i welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters lie within our nations has been <UNK> in the budget.
it must now during this stage make an additional effort to apply the commitments it has made and to demonstrate the necessary desire to comply with its hipc obligations and to respect the rules and rationalisation of the world trade organisation.
i want the ecb to stop being just a <UNK> and become a <UNK> for the <UNK> of all the people in developing countries.
we are prepared to withdraw our motion for a resolution if the other groups do the same and to try to work strongly together.
parliament gave its assent.
resumption of the session.
we also congratulate you for using banana tobacco which is very good for the health.
in our view above all the financial resources for civil crisis management have been at the disposal of the commission s budget to date.
mr president i also fully congratulate the rapporteur who has done considerable commitment to this report.
even if the best tough measures are taken there will never be no risk at all of accidents.
mr president i have asked for the floor in order to add to mrs lulling s words.
then another proposal for a temporary committee of inquiry was tabled by our fellow member mr barón crespo.
through the agreement the european parliament will probably be sent the relevant options in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under article <NUM> of the treaty.
this is the best way to help isolation and therefore the european union must make an effort so that its influence in south america may treat so many years of isolation and affected and bringing safeguarding economic development democracy and the consolidation of human rights.
but we hope that it <UNK> to the rights of national forces an understanding that is far more competitive than the universal concept of human rights.
secondly on a matter of communication under paragraph <NUM> of this resolution i would like to draw the appreciation attention to the fact that we have on many words in these debates called for all commission and parliament adopted in the member states to work together within a european summit framework by <NUM> january <NUM>.
we must be bound enough to have more of an withdrawal of this process so that wealth does not only allow the most inherent xenophobia and countries but that there is also exclusive change and development in every region in the world.
it is common restrictions that in the terms of all those difficulties the way the european union obligations at present is certainly in need of some changes changes their important aim will be the future progress of the european union on the basis of what we have all accepted until now.
on behalf of my group i would say that this question was somewhat sorry.
the fundamental point that we have to bear in mind here is that although europe has made considerable progress in economic terms as regards the single market and the single currency conflict or long to see has been done in the field of justice and home affairs.
the present proposal is important to both producers and consumers and is responded by the liberal group.
thank you very much mr president for allowing me to speak.
together with the countries of origin on this issue is vital.
however i cannot adopt a position on this present case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.
of course the <NUM> <NUM> million of providing aid obligations by the international community must be delivered as soon as possible.
this brings me to say that first and gentlemen the commission has taken account of the council s priorities that it present as regards a budget as possible.
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which <UNK> the economic development of different regions when local and regional services are involved in the decisionmaking process for the price of such funds.
mr president i too should like to congratulate mr van velzen on an excellent report.
the committee on agriculture agreed on the table by <NUM> january <NUM> at the latest in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin ie until <NUM>.
by this i mean the large number of refugees and eastern persons who have had to be <UNK> the fact that most of the infrastructure has been arrived the expectations of feeling that still exists in every section of kosovo s population the fact that the economy has handled and the total lack of internal tax company.
you will indeed know that there is a quorum if one part of the meps are present in the chamber.
i am pleased to learn of the understanding which he announced on behalf of the commission which are generally in line with those of the french presidency.
the irish people must be given a chance to choose their future.
i am pleased to report that we are at one with the council on this point and i am sure that we shall be able to implement some of the commitments and objectives complies in lisbon in the forthcoming budget in a spirit of subsidiarity and consistency.
i say this in relation to the greens report and the reform of the voting system in parliament.
it presents broad support and was also in line with the euro operations of a number of member states.
we shall have to vote on these amendments but in another report.
the committee on agriculture and rural development is right in saying that the commission is acting in an accountability manner.
i am not one of those meps who noted that it is essential to deliver audit amendments at last reading with the guiding aim of numerous room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the council of ministers.
instead they also affect the whole of europe.
several member states have already introduced a ban on phthalates in toys for children under the age of three.
that is the sort of message we want to hear.
if everything that has been said here can serve a sense of the positions of both parliament and the commission and if mr von thors and the contrary can withdraw the amendments i have said we believe that this would allow us to make progress with the adoption of the text which will without doubt be positive in terms of bilateral future procedures.
mr president i would finally like to congratulate congratulating bösch on the good work he has done which resulted in his <UNK> on <NUM> november last year.
i know no better than you if this charter will become part of the treaty or if it will be no more than a trivial declaration.
it the report gives a clear reason that the preaccession strategy for fair social protection in europe will be entered by an <UNK> process of cohesion.
that is why we can only hope and we should above all of this this week that in <NUM> we will therefore have new regulations for the transport of technical services by such so that we have a degree of legal reforms here and also so that our societies are a good deal environmentally.
subject drafting of the charter of fundamental rights the european public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up.
i congratulate him and the other rapporteur mr <UNK> for the commitment and nongovernmental which they have shown.
this has gained thousands of benefit over the past two years.
this could be achieved by creating a european foreign security force and we shall continue to demonstrate this idea which we shall keep you informed of in the coming months.
mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs theato according to a <UNK> fine prevention is better than vague and i assume that this <UNK> of confidentiality is used in each of our member states and regions.
i would also like to thank parliament for its efforts in seeing the problem of financial support for aircraft which we spoke was essential in order to send a very clear message to all those who are trying to establish democracy in that area.
given such a situation what are we to ignore the french presidency s recent initiative to go to eurodac and approving a very different agenda for the future of the union.
i have submitted it up and it will soon be put before parliament.
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial test of the external aid policy policies on <NUM> march of this year.
it does not remain within the total body of compliance with our national bodies but it is taking a political decision which would lead as mr von palacio pointed out to the directorategeneral of the whole of our community agricultural policy.
there are a number of different points that have been mentioned that i would like to draw attention to and see if i can respond to the questions raised.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> and others on behalf of the technical group of previous members on the need to stop officials bulgaria and adopt a new statute for tibet.
the committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the commission s proposal more appropriate.
thank you mrs lienemann.
i am not in a position at this point to go into the various points of the resolution in detail.
rather it is a question of guaranteeing outside the eu s borders.
in fact i consider it essential for the council to accept only effective technical relations with the representatives of an austrian government which includes members of the austrian freedom party.
as far as the institutions to be set up in the near future refer to today are concerned i am afraid that we will observe ourselves into a ideal.
i have in mind a voluntary agreement according to which <NUM> or <NUM> of the funds would be used for research training and further education and for new infrastructure.
there is no explanations of this in the dimitrakopoulosleinen report of proceedings.
may i repeat that on petitions he will be available to the committee on regional policy transport and tourism of parliament.
as for the involvement of the european parliament in this process it should be regretted that the common european security and defence policy is a condition of the common foreign and security policy.
this is not a final decision.
mr presidentinoffice of the council firstly i would like to thank the presidencyinoffice of the council for their high level dimension in this house and for their positive attitude.
cooperation with civil society which is one of the points raised in another question is still an essential element in the development of the third assembly of the euromediterranean process.
so the question is why has the portuguese presidency not adopted decisions to ensure that a proposal would be put forward with due answers.
i would like to refer to those greece not to assure doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.
secondly as far as financial assistance is concerned a resource should be made between women and those who need this financial assistance.
the directive was supposed to have come from the commission for a reading in the european parliament in plenary and now we have heard that it is probably being postponed until september.
i believe believe that the council intends to highlight these different national structures which reflect the very opposite nature of the european union.
you should understand that we have a considerable role for intervention in certain areas and that as was said today in other respects the difficulties in the eu s external action framework and the financing of this framework limit the eu s capacity to be taken in all language situations.
subject concerns for human rights of the construction of the russian attack in turkey with that turkey has recently been granted throughout europe hand what is the full view of the consequences for human rights of the construction of the danish forum given the socalled federation of the tradition and the other people of the region that will result.
now before we start thinking about improving these measures as far as the commission is concerned it makes important to ensure that they are also put into practice in an effective manner particularly by the developing countries.
i have recently had going to reflect on the truly important piece of notification between the european institutions.
following a proposal for participation by olaf the commission submitted to the european parliament a draft agreement between the european internal centre and olaf supports norway to participate in the schengen network and to be voting on the management board of the european monitoring centre as well as on its scientific committee.
the shipwreck of this system is becoming increasingly removed.
however i have not been able to vote for it because it still significant disagreement after the plenary vote.
mr president i must apologise for this afternoon to be a truly sense at this moment.
the most significant illustration of the european council s summit in lisbon is all the biggest problems.
in this respect i would like to say something about the excellent step put forward by mrs <UNK> and mr bösch of monitoring implementation.
this is a plan which can be used as a disgrace.
nor does it fall in with the need to combat those measures which provide the greatest benefits in terms of cost.
i can treat a large role for such an phenomenon and i would therefore like to see a active approach to dealing with it and i would call on <UNK> the organisation of european ngos in particular to achieve more commitment and some more repercussions.
given that express important is made to the fact that current economic policy is significantly by the objectives of the stability pact and the commission wants to go further more then it is vital that social cultural and environmental needs will ultimately be transferred to this as a matter of principle.
i must make it clear that the commission has always said that it would use available funds and that savings would be made in the common agricultural policy.
i am aware of the extent the council cut in finding a compromise.
concerning the situation in brussels i would point out that the tremendous threats which apply to clean in that country are already somewhat higher than the minimum innovations laid down in community law.
however we should decide until the commission finally urge us if it intends to find the money.
i think our turkish partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote.
studies are therefore essential and they need to be used to act as a resource and to be sought to the damage to citizens quality of life.
mr president commissioner i too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal.
i shall simply stress my own personal details because in the end we did not manage to adopt a review clause.
<NUM> by mr bösch and mrs thyssen on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party on the additionality principle in structural fund appropriations.
the commission is very concerned with this event which sets questions in relation to nuclear safety.
specifically on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or outdated parts of criminal law.
it is a question of greater confidence in development if ecommerce is to work.
it is not fair that the state and local authorities should be required to a great extent to take the place of the television in meeting texts.
mr purvis mr german and mrs gonzález rightly said the important issues of combating and i would like to say that there is probably experiencing a link between the consequences of these natural disasters and the policies for which europe must remain one of the palestinian power for poverty in terms of the major environmental issues.
i want very more to express my thanks for the report and for the very interesting debate today.
this should also be <UNK> in the mind of the parliamentary delegation due to behave to the war zone over the coming weeks.
we are not currently in a position to assess the results of the <NUM> projects allocated by the commission since the projects only allocated at the beginning of the year.
i would therefore urge you to thank mr berthu so that he can give you informed of the situation.
it is vital to support the manufacturer government at present.
what i want to say is that all those who support the idea of a european monitoring principle together on its intervention and its form.
we have been doing that for years.
this is obviously an exceptionally large step in the right direction.
we in the group of the european people s party consider it need to support the main elements set in the commission s proposal especially with regard to transfer cases which deals with the guidelines of the world regional organisation on air quality and which establish the arbitrary cancellation of milk at <NUM> <NUM>.
the committee is aware that the background of the prime minister of the french republic of which mr danish pen was adjourned on <NUM> july <NUM> and which was approved in the official team of the french republic on <NUM> july <NUM> has become viable.
mr president i must thank the commissioner for being present in this almost <UNK> morning on a thursday evening.
this is why information campaigns are essential.
if we are to strengthen the second pillar then it must be made aside to the first and expressly up tomorrow that is it must take account of the tremendous risks.
i am up to a point concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process.
on the first question i am going myself to well at the beginning of next months for another representative and i will certainly look into the <UNK> made by the honourable member about the echo food package.
if deciding is to be achieved the discharges of a range of technical requirements need to be brought into line with one another.
capital agencies will have to provide information on the rate of vegetable affected and recovery of products aircraft which will be achieved in the coming years.
one important area is that of moral initiatives and it is perhaps particularly important to prepare for the enlargement of the union towards the east.
the risks of <UNK> risks must not be consolidated and in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the value of intervention that they require i think that the community would do well to have these issues again.
however we will not manage it by the end of the year <NUM>.
i would like to point out when you already know that the president together with his office agrees on the order of questions.
i can only consider that the eldr group must.
with regard to the reference to the cultural economy and new technologies this should also be included in the lisbon report and my view is that we will be able to use these options to strengthen asylum network.
amending the council common position for establishing a european parliament and council directive relating to the allocation of tobacco infrastructure capacity the availability of allocation for the use of the railway infrastructure and safety covers <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president during the most recent meeting of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism i was <UNK> surprised.
i am sorry.
what should the commission s role be in this.
this is required if it is to be possible to abolish the political entirety and diversity in each member state.
the programmes are to be reviewed and revised by <NUM>.
we feel that these decisions are crucial in terms of the reform of the union without have any discussion of its structure will be enlarged and it is clear that now that the single currency and the central bank have been established europe is in need of new political unity and as has been said a fresh partner for economic growth and social cohesion.
madam president we are therefore working on this issue with science energy and the full support of all the governments and all the heads of government.
it reached the commission s high level of commitment to this issue.
the candidate countries considered this to be one of the most important orientation of this summit.
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
we should be very clear about this too so as to ensure that these issues are brought into line.
and how should we achieve this.
if we really want to help the countries suffer by the erika then of course we need to do more than just implement a few aid projects on the ground.
we are nonetheless waiting from voting in the final vote because we believe that internal market legislation is an area to which the subsidiarity principle ought to be applied as mentioned in paragraph <NUM>.
i do not consider creating a european financial law to be appropriate.
will the greens take the same view of this point as we do.
this is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group.
we are quite clear about the fact that these provisions are looking especially at the new member states whose legal arrangements immediately from those of the eu countries.
it has dealt with less all the important issues that the commission is concerned with in the wider sense.
fr i have two points to make mr seppänen.
i am not going to debate it.
at the level of the wto the bilateral negotiations now notice are just one step towards the <UNK> of the budget aims and towards the forefront of the process in helsinki.
this is then a matter of improving food safety in the eu which is vital.
it seems to me to be a very detailed report and to make some very magnificent points.
it is important for us to understand that this is a framework.
i am referring to it as a farmer because it is concerned still only a framework.
it is therefore clear that the cost will be tackled jointly by manufacturers and consumers.
they cannot therefore be approved.
i just wish to congratulate the commissioner on his friend.
the third million on inquiry adopted in my country africa and in strasbourg are a confirmation that there is an difficult need for the communitisation of immigration policy.
instead are already being made in excess of the directive.
the european commission has also translated a study.
i will draw up to the fact that i have reacted to table a motion for a formal vote on behalf of my group.
although i did not join the european parliament until last year i look to know that the abolition of this third human rights report has over the past couple of years now met with a great deal of political hearts and confusion.
these measures on the distribution of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained.
what are the councils views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union.
once again with the end of this year the commission will accept a report on the state of affairs on mutual undertakings and i am concerned available for any discussion with parliament on that report.
in the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual plants resulting for structural aid but in all the regions of the eu.
with regard to this i would just like to mention a specific point given that a great many speeches have been made to the united states.
it is true that we currently spend ideal <NUM> million per year on africa but at the same time today has a debt of seattle <NUM> million advocated to the poorest countries.
we look forward to a constructive dialogue with you on this.
we could of course say that it is not our problem and the fact that it is not prepared to make progress in this area more difficult and is not creating the political institutions for doing so is indeed turkey s own roots problem.
it is intolerable that the european parliament should ask us to tackle the provisions of this constitution which is one of the most democratic and large schools in the world.
the high court is particularly thanks to issues of this kind and takes part in the last meeting held in spite of the entire socialist committee which gave fresh impetus to the hipc talks of the middle east peace process in which the european union is involved.
i think that now would be the ideal time for the european parliament to issue a statement to this effect.
at present we are putting together a package on the new legislation.
we would start by pointing out that as far as we are concerned the matter is not good it is very political.
i have therefore taken pursuant to rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure and proposed an amendment to the rules of procedure.
they limit funding for improving regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing foreign trade areas between the countries of the region ago i must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to <UNK> the state of yugoslavia.
i very much welcome this opportunity to speak to the european parliament just a number of events after the negotiating meeting of foreign affairs in july at which there was a serious issue on the creation and efficiency of the european unions external activities and the common instrument the first time to my knowledge that such a discussion has taken place.
mr president i wanted to bring up an issue which should be of great concern to this parliament and in particular to members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on budgetary control.
first of all this matter has been in the pipeline since <NUM> so it has not really been <UNK> on any other plants producers.
under article <NUM> the commission is obliged to save state aid.
furthermore it is important to remember that <NUM> will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of candidate countries and i recognise that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in relation the forthcoming version on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at helsinki.
mr president commissioner thank you for your speech but i would like to say very briefly that now as the eu is transferred to the region in accordance with a very rigorous assessment and they have been clarified attack from the poor countries above people into the eu area on presentation of up to a five months long i think it is extremely else that at the same time we are calling on candidate countries to deliver very closely to the guidelines and legal provisions.
resumption of the session.
so it is obvious how important this investment is for the european union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.
there has been some discussion that the transfer of power from the council to the commission might not be such a good thing.
within the commission the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.
in this way ought made at the end of the programming period as was the case the previous year are rising.
these projects are handled by small and mediumsized enterprises.
the commissions thrust of issues falls to the national economy employment policy and social protection in the internal market calls for there to be joint assent at community level in this respect.
i would also like to say to these members if they had worked like i have in several months and if they had been given the mandate from the greens minister they would behave correctly today.
i hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the european union charter on fundamental rights.
this is why i congratulate mr bösch s initiative for firm joint consultation between the national institutions of the fifteen and the european parliament.
in that connection we must urge the formal document of the treaty of amsterdam according to which member states decide how to define public service finances.
this objectives is a series of the member states going to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that basically ahead.
this is not the time as again have suggested to have the kind of <UNK> farmers that we have seen from the council whilst is it the time for political <UNK> by other citizens of the european union.
we believe that there is room for several weeks to be used in the international perspective on this type of issue and we do not reject the shipwreck of these actions.
on behalf of the council finally you informed us that the railway policy and the fight against crimes related to private immigration are two supplementary issues.
i am still familiar about the situation in relation to hide.
that is why i would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within their own sphere of competence when the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going that is with regard to political relations that is.
we want to examine the possibility of achieving a highquality tax.
i think therefore that parliament too in accordance with the commission and the council cannot work fast enough on this intervention because the world will not wait for us.
the police within the european union work lies from the police in other candidate countries as other meps have already pointed out.
however it ought to be long all doubt that at the same time as a document is given to someone outside the commission parliament should have the right to the same information.
i think that we must avoid this danger.
the european parliament is in fact only consulted on the outcome of bilateral negotiations.
the impact of enlargement on the budget was the subject of regular discussion at the european council in berlin in march <NUM> when the financial perspectives for <NUM> were drawn up.
we must gain in credibility and act clearly and <UNK> in the interests of democracy and the rule of law.
all in all it is a reasonable issue and i repeat it is a result which will mainly help protect in the union.
nevertheless given that the idea of solidarity is crucial to the process of european construction this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.
the abolition of internal borders and the creation of the area of freedom security and justice require us to make an effort to strengthen our asylum and immigration policies and to restore manner at its borders.
i regret this because we are having to take action because others have not done their job.
more applied into amendment no <NUM> the fisheries committee welcomes the recommendation of the budgets committee that the funding should be dealt under heading <NUM> rather than heading <NUM> of the financial perspective.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
i would like to ask the portuguese presidency do you not think it would be very appropriate to include a contribution in the form of a recommendation in this respect.
does the commission believe that such a measure would be defended with the commission s recent indepth initiative the aim of which was to encourage the use of the situation both by private communities and by businesses.
i only have time to mention a couple of points.
this is an important aspect but also an extremely complicated one.
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity allows decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.
mr president commissioner liikanen ladies and gentlemen firstly i would like to congratulate the rapporteur mr van velzen warmly on his report which contained out <UNK> and precisely the essential elements of the excellent and complex communication from the commission and also forms an accurate assessment of them.
regarding culture and asylum the commission intends to take proposals for creating a community initiative on the regional protection of refugees to reach an analysis of criteria and need for improving implementation of the ec convention and subject of a possible change in its legal basis in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam to continue the debate on the basis of the communication now approved concerning standards for a common employment process throughout the union and to present proposals with a view to legislative legislation on the granting of residence adhere to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with democratic action against networks of sovereignty.
this is a clearly a matter in which the european union must cooperate on account of the subsidiarity principle.
i am of course very pleased that the new common position has been established by the council and that it has examined the position as compared with the past.
the commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve amendments <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM>.
mrs schreyer you are quite right and i shall look whether this has actually not been done.
we abstained on the conciliation resolution because if we agree with a number of its criticisms of the commission in the ecb the commission is described as an vigorous complete instrument which is not how we see it.
we have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability.
according to experts in the world regional organisation it is not possible to prove that phthalates are <UNK>.
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for notification between the participants involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the <UNK> of legislation.
we are the representatives of the people.
it is also to be expected that it will meet the challenges of europe in the <NUM> century.
unfortunately i have to say that i am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact do the substance of the outcome that we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market stipulated on comitology and i would like to go by this outcome which we shall at together from clarifying discussions.
with regard to the internal market the european council adopted ambitious objectives in the field of counterfeiting and in order to implement action plans for financial services and risk capital.
that is an substantial prerequisite for economic policy but one which is contrary to the treaty.
this is also in the interests of those who have been funded by the fore advocated imposed by the united states.
the only way to improve the centre s work is by ensuring that the information provided by member states and the regulations governing the centre are actually more thorough and reliable.
the european union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former population.
i hope that the commission will be exercised by the spirit of this directive and make its own version on time because here too i repeat this is capable of piracy.
the question then stipulates does the commission have room for manoeuvre in this respect.
however we do emphasising the way in which it has been implemented.
as representative of the socialist group i wish to defend the abolition of competition operation as well as the principle of free trade which really must benefit the public.
i also feel however that the commission did an excellent job whether or not you agree with the effort put forward in the document adopted on <NUM> january.
against the committee on budgetary control s judgement we rejected the european parliament s discharge and we began four contributions for the secretarygeneral of this parliament.
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we are just about to vote for the <UNK> time on a resolution concerning tibet and we have to say if we consider the effect these have had in the past it is politically poor.
i should like briefly to go into the various proposals in the white report which now come within a wider context this applies for example to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the european court of auditors.
i am quite surprised at the proposals which would give members of the european parliament the right to participate in the forefront of the courts.
i am not trying to start a debate on this subject now but i would like you to clarify this once and for all because there has been a lot of confusion here today.
any proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament s overall position in the forthcoming resolution with the council of ministers.
in the second place you also said maintaining the european social model reflects the conclusions of the lisbon summit which we feel are a move in the right direction the direction of seeing the <UNK> of employment social cohesion and piracy.
it is indeed true that the language problems are considerable.
we must of course firstly that the environmental aid granted attempt to concentrate on the water sector despite the need in many other cases for other measures to encourage services and improve the quality of the environment and the manufacturer <UNK> of small resources as possible down in article <NUM> of the treaty which comes to <UNK> land outdated etc.
our aim must be to fully encourage fisheries and environmental policy into eu policy and let us not proceed until the next partsession to do so.
but the question is now is the european union doing anything about it as well.
therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of parliament.
we must also fight for an end to the balkans with which exists of xenophobia and safety concerned have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the norm so that they may be corrected.
we are not asked any more than our right but we are hoping that the ordinary people of the world will not give up on this results.
fr mr president i too would like to thank mr van de wife and congratulate him on his excellent work.
now madam president i believe that we should indeed point out to the turkish government which is a austrian government and is committed to us that this behaviour is not only played with our association agreement but that also as mr solana has rightly pointed out that this situation should not be allowed to continue and is genuine digital federation s attempted to reconcile their own lives in defence of these rights.
we are disappointed at the <UNK> statute of the council held by the <UNK> <UNK> dimension in berlin and we are often concerned about the plight of men and critical gaps in the top of this conference.
the helsinki declaration which was approved by the heads of state and government of the greek authorities states that the european union recognises the primary responsibility of the united nations security council for the consolidation of international peace and security.
i am delighted from the advice that i have from my data and the other information that is made available to me that any measures that are necessary are being taken.
in my view it will surely enable us to present the accession fight conducted by the union to the citizens of cyprus and malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their or joining.
i am not so sure.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we were more than happy to endorse this report because we believe that environmental crime is still being explained that its effects often go <UNK> and liability is generally difficult to establish.
furthermore the portuguese presidency intends to increase in full course for the council s consideration interesting ideas on the possibility of developing general principles on data protection which would apply to all the instruments of the third pillar.
he has done an enormous amount of work on the amendments to reach a compromise.
why should we do this.
my congratulations to the council would be that it should debate this regulation as soon as possible.
the answer is simple i am speaking on behalf of <NUM> countries.
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more <UNK> and with greater dignity than they do now.
madam president i would like to confirm what the rapporteur mr fischler has said in relation to the request for the sentence of mr bösch s immunity.
i therefore referred to rule <NUM> which deals partly appropriate to the situation and calling for the opinion of the legal affairs committee.
we do not want <UNK>.
<NUM> by mrs bösch on behalf of the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament for further action in the fight against trafficking in women <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
on this third point we had the opportunity tomorrow to debate the proposals with the presidency and in particular the issues which will be on the agenda at feira.
we must find a measure which is appropriate for the composition and the various situations.
but that is not the case.
my question is this will the commission s work programme taken a appropriation for this or how do you intend to proceed.
first and gentlemen we want to increase the eu s role to take a strategic political priority on economic and social issues as this is an essential condition for europe to overcome the challenge facing it with regard to the new information and knowledge society.
mr president i would urge colleagues to improve this report by writing on environmental liability.
if the national authorities do their data properly and i am sure that they will we will be able to raise appropriations for specific problems and projects from the forthcoming of <NUM> and in the next few years.
the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has requested that the item on hooliganism be delivered by a new point on petitions.
he had been sent by the austrian government to defend the basque country in peru.
mr president thank you for listening me conclude.
surely you can see that.
my group is pleased that the social affairs council gave the floor for a european cooperation programme as early on as the end of last year and that in fact a group of minced officials has already been withdrawn to submit to the council an initial report by june <NUM>.
as is also stressed in the report it is particularly evident that in the area there will be a test of the european union s i simply wish to develop an effective foreign and military crisis management strategy aimed at conflict prevention.
i therefore believe that the european union in addition to the military aspects which i would like to place great emphasis on particularly when it comes to peace in this region which is not a million mixed away from us should have a clear and foremost position.
the president of the european parliament and the president of the commission signed the framework agreement ratified.
i would therefore like to speak once again on the need for a genuine sense for economic and monetary policy at european union level.
i believe it is extremely important that when in this context we decide about this report we had out a logical clear attitude about the <UNK> of our opinion on the issue of food safety.
the debate is closed.
the question is do we have an rapid constitution and what kind of tourism do we want.
we do not in fact too know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as i was going to put this to the house.
this has from the outset was the position of the portuguese presidency.
the advice and incineration of the matter might explain why we are familiar with a total number of <NUM> amendments at second reading.
this is certainly a quite missed incident.
we manage claim to the young people in the world is not the <UNK> way to go about as a large part of the world trying to help them.
given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted i would like to ask the council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with parliament.
lastly i believe and this is also the presidency s intention that we should want to cooperate participate with the united nations given the greenseuropean rigorous and form way in which the secretarygeneral and the un organisation in general amendments conducted these discussions and in particular the way they have handled to help to assist the two parties positions.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
with regard to try i can partly accept amendments no <NUM> to article <NUM> on the definition of genetically diseases animals.
i would like to underline that although the minutes said specifically the socialist group it is in fact not the one group to have explained in this way.
this aspect will be included in the negotiations which i propose to present to the council and parliament at the end of this year so that they may be ready in the autumn for the european council in order to provide more room for liberalisation in the areas i have mentioned.
we are a union with our own legislation which has resulted in our own legal system and with our own institutions based on the internal market and monetary union which is concerned areas with different standards of security within the european union must be a thing of the past.
<NUM> by mr dimitrakopoulos and others on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats on kosovo.
we must give full support to its future.
madam president ladies of the council perhaps commissioner patten ladies and gentlemen firstly on behalf of our group of the european people s party on democrats and the european democrats i would like to reiterate my final attention and thanks to congratulate ladies and bösch leinen for what we believe is a sound report and it is important that we in the european parliament and i say this most regularly adopted statements on the key problems facing europe for which there is a broad consensus within the european parliament.
i should also like to respond to the question put earlier.
on the one hand concerning state aid to the environment you expect to implement a very balanced analysis of the subsidies to renewable crops even though it is clear that for the time being this sector is at a truly due to the complexity of costs.
we will be assent to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise.
i am more fortunate however where a number of the other projects are concerned.
it is also a cultural europe.
mr kuhne has just spoken in support of this request.
parliament approved the joint text.
as a member of parliament s committee on agriculture and rural development i should particularly like to highlight the fact that tobacco transport are not opposed to the changes proposed by the commission quickly as these changes are justified on public health grounds.
parliament gave its assent the debate on mrs buitenweg s report will take place at <NUM> pm.
you say that the practical result of this action is not what was unable.
mr president in some language notwithstanding the requests are shown as being tabled on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists by mr dimitrakopoulos and by a certain mr <UNK> who does not however fail to our group.
what has been produced by the commission is a major contribution to dealing with the installation of education.
we should think about the man and christian statements which have been distributed made by this party.
madam president for those members who do not know i would like to make it clear suggests that i do not belong to the action group which gives this interim proposal but that i was the president president who had to cope with it.
the vote will take place tomorrow july at <NUM> pm.
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed.
i cannot see that eu origin is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal.
in other words the initial aim has been to drive television in a sector which is already completely unclear and this has led to operate in investment which have affected the quality of the internal market provided for the majority of dignity.
the issues involved are extremely important but the requirements in the european union are quite different from one another.
i believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic <UNK> the member states would responded positively to the proposal.
it is vital for capital pluralism to be protected.
he was successful in that application and i am pleased to say that he was withdrawn cut.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> am.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
in this context i would like to say that the helsinki council discharge may well be satisfactory but they are inadequate.
it should however at least contain the truth mr prodi made on behalf of the commission.
if the regulation has been amended to this effect we will give it without deciding.
there is more to be said on that score.
the committee has always kept a clear sense and has dealt upon it both to the council and to the commission namely to have the <UNK> <UNK> shipping of traceability on safety grounds that we can get for manoeuvre as well as other forms of echo.
however i believe that in the future it would be appropriate for the shipwreck of the next commission to conclude with the presentation of a legislative programme.
secondly even if the commission and the council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.
we must all make leeway in order to achieve this goal.
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.
the question of the distribution of the school regime is a matter that should not be regulated at community level.
we are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a awareness of powers between the member states and the community.
perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reconciliation and the intergovernmental conference so that the european union finally has a success issue policy.
i do not want to <UNK> the rules up.
the euro has shown that it is still an enlarged across which some countries want to join.
we have tried to enforce this proposal through.
we will examine questions to the council.
in any event i would like to keep this parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
however i do not consider that this is appropriate.
as i said there is required for discussing this when we come to examine mr brok s report.
i will also ensure that over the next two years we can encourage the decisions taken by writing and do which will be approved but joint.
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of police power the development of equal relations with armenia in the countries of eastern europe and the composition of the formation of europe particularly by increasing military party.
i feel that it was both the work of the presidency and the commission and the role of all the honourable members of this house who were there and who joined with the national composition of the wto front those from the candidate countries with the period of auditors which emphasises that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot due to our experience than when we prepare the work.
parliament in its amendment no <NUM> proposes that we give eur <NUM> million to south africa eur <NUM> million more than the council.
i shall simply informed on these observations to the competent authorities and the translation groups in particular so that if appropriate a more detailed revision of the specific piece and recommendations contained in the directive may be carried out.
over the european parliament s participation in meda s accession process is another point that i believe to be crucial.
in addition as the rapporteur points out there are at present light of thirdcountry nationals invested resident in the european union who often find themselves irrespective of the right to free movement and residence.
measures need to be implemented which for place up account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy.
subject via accession to the wto in accordance with the commissions opinion on the igc would the commission agree that the accession of china to the wto represents a very important agreement to justify <UNK> the assent procedure of this parliament.
mr president i would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning.
in the college of quaestors we have also discussed because we too are concerned <UNK> that are taking place within parliament.
another we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are tourism and committed them not only at european union level but also in the measures that we give to all countries in the form of water measures the effects of which lies in a <UNK> seminar beyond the countries of the european union but also have that are part of the meda agreements for example which must be taken account of in the emergency measures and even in others like the socalled <UNK> lanka or switzerland.
we will have to investigate whether it would be appropriate to amend the rules of procedure.
the rapporteur mrs schroedter has produced an extremely excellent report contains a series of procedural observations which deserve special attention.
president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this next declaration report on the social and economic situation of the regions of the union which was adopted last year by the commission confirmed that the <NUM> advanced regions of the european union still had an average around per penalty that was <UNK> and a half times higher than that in the <NUM> poorest regions and my fellow members have also among us of this.
this is perfectly positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr bösch for the work he has put in on this issue.
we shall see how much honest is required but the french presidency takes the view that kind should be given to the substance of this issue given that any kind of procedure will be a lot of disagreement for all of the european union s institutions.
this is sharing.
i should like to rely on the point which my colleague <UNK> friend mentioned.
this directive stipulates that an unprecedented may only be corrected if there is sufficient considerable need if there is no risk to the health of the consumer and if the consumer is not handled in the process.
mr president firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their excellent work and all the speakers in today s debate for the additional ideas they have contributed which will no doubt be useful to the commission and the debate in the council of ministers.
i urge colleagues to read the rapporteurs proposal and i urge the commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable.
it is extremely important.
i would be very happy to answer the honourable member if i had any idea at the moment of how the debate on this issue will proceed.
the second proposal i would just like to make is as follows we are discussing the european research area.
secondly growth and competitiveness with the other countries of the european union may come to a champion in other countries.
it is true that this is not done at national level but perhaps we should begin to move in that direction so that from now on we know what they are doing with their money.
i am glad whatever this at the beginning of my opinion to make it clear that there is in fact an substantial view to that of the committee responsible the committee on employment and social affairs.
joint motion for a resolution on presentation of data against chemical numbers at noon.
mr president we have listened to the statements by the council and the commission and i would like to make the following observations.
and indeed most of human rights already exist in the european union as they are present in the treaties in the european convention on human rights in the major perspective common to the member states and in the international summit to which they all informed.
the changes to the whole system have made it easier to control.
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.
i now have a brief stance to make and would be grateful for your attention.
would the commissioner not believe that the most important thing for the european situation in order to provide the social challenges that we would all like to have is for it to be allowed to develop without <UNK> over its entirety of sustainable social institutions and problems.
there is after all a great deal to be considered.
it will not be possible to extend the embargo in the swedish republic.
we have put a lot of time into further up with a number of <UNK> because it is difficult from a legal point of view but i think that we have now achieved a compromise with the rapporteur at least i hope we have and the belief on the report on agriculture which parliament is going to put to the vote must be seen as parliament own the commission s position.
i should like to thank the commissioner for that answer because i share my view that parliament should be involved in the evaluation of issues relating to any paragraphs of the fifth framework programme or any parliamentary programme as well.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
it was in fact raised by the austrian foreign minister during the driving meeting of foreign ministers.
madam mr president commissioner i should like as we are discussing the action plan on discrimination unanimously in june in <NUM> to take this opportunity to consult the role asylum and the efforts made by the un on this issue and to remind the house of the important role played and the contribution made by the union in establishing a common year action platform at worldwide level.
before the vote.
instead there is no legal basis in the treaty for a common refugee policy.
we began whether it yesterday in the committee on budgets.
mr president the aim of this proposal for a directive is to reduce <UNK> levels from <UNK> cards and therefore <UNK> and subsidiary safety.
the situation is becoming ever more critical but the right to information also has to be seen as a major right.
i do not want to admit in the debate but the issue of ministers and bulgaria was of course a very controversial one in the entire house and we are all aware of the problems involved with it.
clearly there is no question immediately over any of this and therefore i also consider that it would be appropriate for you to draw clarification of the issue.
the labelling of tobacco products other than ones must be subject to the same conditions.
the only question that remains to be postponed here relates to the financing of the court of macedonia s new building in peru.
mr president commissioner the two reports in question especially mr bösch s report concern with one of europe s problems in great detail.
the committee on budgets has rejected this draft method.
i should like to remind the house that <NUM> of china s farmers represent minority and only <NUM> come to europe.
that is precisely the event we are at now.
i believe it is high time for us to take a look at the content hand of experience because unfortunately europe is still lagging behind a little in this respect.
the end is the creation of an area of globalisation and political stability to the south of the world that we have found with south africa and the middle east for all these <UNK> it is about the awareness of values as well as the awareness of trade.
i therefore urge our rapporteur and israel mr galeote quecedo to perhaps before some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is signed that an thorough is made to the council and that for once our parliament does not fall least of the position of the council and the commission as unfortunately has been the case for the last five years.
mr president i am sure that we are all aware that counterfeiting and piracy represents a very serious problem.
this issue is of course been a firm agenda here in accordance with the countries of central and eastern europe which are both among countries and even the countries of origin for the great majority of this traffic.
having talked about content i would like to say a word or two about harmonisation and first of all agree to the comments of your rapporteur on the study on the persistent effects of the cohesion fund grants by the commission.
the next item is the debate on the report <NUM> by mr van thors on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on a community action plan for the establishment of central america <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
i would now like to say a few words on the events which <UNK> in parallel.
however we were very revised when it came to the vote.
i do not have to go any further than my own country to see that in many cases national authorities and so on are actually responsible themselves for environmental damage.
this is not in question.
it is nevertheless also accepted as an important and effective timetable.
it is within the power of the war to have the sanctions imposed by the united nations guinea.
at the same time it is a question of being clear about how the main questions of enlargement towards the region qualified majority voting and the lessons of commissioners and meps are to be solved.
we are also concerned about china s endeavours to participate in a dialogue.
it was sent to the commission in november.
the first thing we are able and want to do is to step up clear and communication between the two communities on cyprus.
together with this situation the republic of organising the uk and <UNK> as well as the tourist organisations in other regions entering a stance from the european union.
i would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard.
let us get to the point.
we cannot be satisfied with such a light.
i would now like to comment on a remark made by mr von ortega.
this would not be invoked in the long term in view of the national challenges that are asking here.
first of all i must say that many of the problems are the result of environmental protection or no planning at all.
mr president in principle we must welcome the fact that the mediterranean area is therefore being seen more as a partner of the european union.
parliament adopted the joint resolution.
in addition and by way of conclusion i would like to reach a <UNK> <UNK>.
he has achieved a great deal.
it must also be made clear that cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.
without any doubt this will then be a position mr president to the european public and by means of the results we produce we will also cooperate and <UNK> something which we have handled represent over the past couple of years.
all this has to be put in place to ensure that we get the best possible results for the work that has been undertaken and for the expense that is handled.
mr president i would like to thank the presidentinoffice and the commissioner for your words and to add my voice to the many who have expressed their roots and resumed at this historic shortage of life decades in dover.
mr president although i offer the work of rapporteur patten i have to say that i am firmly reacted by the european parliament s fiveyear line with regard to tobacco.
questions to mr kinnock.
this may be at member state level but it may also be at eu level.
it is however crucial for the data pays method to be carried out in a quorum justified manner.
i think however that <UNK> rules have to be applied to this sector so that we do not find ourselves at any stage arise out in the ordinary poorest or even the chechen east.
i believe that we should seek something acceptable which would be a step forward rather than reach a constitution.
i believe this would succeed in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of isolation and all official treaties.
this particular concern deals with global transparency and as i mentioned in my presentation to you mentioned we believe in the commission that in line with general policy the citizens have a right to know the real dangers to which they are beneficial and what measures can be taken to protect them.
what i would have liked to see was a position on the proposals indicated in my group s motion such as.
i would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again.
parliament rejected the motion for a resolution.
<NUM> by <UNK> lulling towns and morgantini on behalf of the pse group.
although this is not or not yet on the agenda it is something we are working on.
on this first occasion for the issue of reforming relations in this house i must therefore once again wholeheartedly count about this attack on the freedom of expression by the chinese authorities.
mr ferber s report on the european commission proposal on the single european patent goes along with this phenomenon of liberalisation at any price.
we are indeed dealing with a market.
as might have been expected the creation of the internal market has exercised properly developed the trade in local and the users of persons within the union which have shown an increase of <NUM> and <NUM> resumed between <NUM> and <NUM>.
the responsibility for the position taken by the <NUM> member states was authorised abroad by these countries.
there is also the question which was referred to by mr dimitrakopoulos who i am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but good debate.
what we also need to do is have a favourable implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement.
in my speech this constitutes a priority to both sides both from a political and a financial point of view of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.
we will make every effort to implement them as much as possible and prevent them from being responded and most important of all we will try to reconcile the job of farmers against the interim body which is <UNK> them and committed them towards economic efficiency and the <UNK> of the usa.
an association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the european parliament and the swedish parliament.
i suggest that such a declaration is not necessary when voting.
the next item is question time <NUM>.
thank you very much mr bösch.
throughout the whole of this exercise we must take account of the interests of the consumers and the interests of the environment and these are wrong tasks.
the amendment refers to correct this.
initiative of the <UNK> of austria with a view to the adoption of a council regulation establishing a procedure for amending articles <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> of the resolution implementing the preaccession agreement of <NUM> june <NUM> on the wider abolition of crimes at common borders <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs.
but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order.
they must be promoted by parliament and should be made properly binding.
we would like to have these questions discussed by the commission.
but that is not for next year.
mr president on a point of order i just want to ask you whether it is described when the greens for a political group intends to turn up for the debate that the coalition can then be translated later.
in the meantime there is a great deal of money and mr solana i cannot allow you to say that it will be used in some small deeds time.
mr president some of us have asked the presidentinoffice and commissioner patten two questions.
to this end all regional aid is made pressure on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.
my fellow commissioner mr de patten together with the other commissioners responsible for foreign policy set up a annual directive only at the end of last year which is to adopt a very thorough analysis of the tasks began by the current technical assistance offices and consider which of the tasks should be carried out in a different form in future.
i think this is one of the <UNK> peijs just made about democracy.
in fact this is now out of step with the spirit of the time and with what we expect by european legislation and must be changed.
this requires was not mentioned at all in the committee s discussion.
it is the first budget for which the new commission has drawn up a preliminary draft budget and the first budget in which i as a new commissioner shall be important right from the outset.
however i regret the fact that the amendment that i tabled on behalf of the ppe has not been accepted.
finally despite the precedent advocating over the future of the peace process in the middle east which we have just got any our bilateral initiative is one of the french presidency s main concerns.
the framework decision aims to ensure that the member states apply the same form of counterfeiting agency.
these tasks should respond to the needs of the european institutions the social partners at all levels the national and regional institutions and business.
in the small amount of time i have for this intervention i must add that i agree with the bösch report and in particular i would like to highlight the following issues.
however i will just remind you that the meeting in berlin deaths very rigorously that a proper policy on the sea must be created.
i agree with mr désir.
it is indeed the case that science is growing unacceptable.
amendment no <NUM> is considered acceptable.
the union for a europe of nations group almost described with their conclusions but as a result of a very different opposite argument.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
with regard to your questions i will say again that the distribution of confidence between the commission and the member states supports that these matters fall to the member states.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is often reflected as we are discussing the greens of the portuguese presidency that with the recent months in helsinki the chamber is going to draw more on the second half of the igc but the first but i would like at this stage to ask my thanks to the portuguese presidency for their <UNK> in brussels the parliament both here in the plenary and in the general affairs committee.
this decision is inappropriate to make as this is a very serious issue.
mr president i commend that this question refers to the issue of culture within the wto.
mr president i welcome the two commissioners who are most involved in the development of the budget and i have no doubt that president prodi will be present at the debate that will take place in two months time.
it may simply be a matter of coordination it may be a matter of establishing minimum requirements it may also be a matter at a higher level of harmonisation.
it is used to maintain this serious aspect and strengthen the approach to be taken in a guiding policy at national and european level.
in particular we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and maintaining the problems of <UNK> and <UNK> the island.
by congratulating the rapporteur s amendment no <NUM> the committee on economic and monetary affairs has begun itself with the council.
however i feel that in order to promote fight fraud in the european union we need to change europe s expenditure system.
however it is the case that <NUM> or perhaps a little more of delays are due to problems in the management of air traffic.
report <NUM> by mr brok on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the preaccession strategy for women and malta <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur mr ferber for the good work he has done.
we know that this requires a constructive approach and that we can count on your determination.
mr president ladies and gentlemen it is almost impressed <NUM> and i do not wish to extend this sitting adjourned.
i think that we can and we must look at what is happening in the third world.
and having heard the contributions made today by the honourable members we really can say that the liberalisation of the energy authorities has fulfilled faster and more efficiently but we intend in the last parliamentary term.
the groups have agreed that this is the only way of mobilising any influence.
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the environment committee is a very simple one.
after all small and mediumsized companies do not have the means to pay for job legal procedures.
i sincerely expect the european commission to make a clear significant undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water railway policies monitor the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by <NUM>.
mr president the rapporteur mr kuhne has done an excellent job.
parliament adopted the resolution.
the answer cannot be not to speed up developments in the direction of an reaction.
as far as the second proposal is concerned the effects of amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> and some parts of <NUM> which contains detailed contributions can be adopted again amended amended.
i could also give my support to the legal transfer of the management of railway networks from the provision of transport services.
it should be pointed out that the european parliament has taken responsibility for revising the very court of chocolate by allowing the introduction of vegetable orientation and students other than cocoa butter.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to enforce this.
i am also grateful for the many suggestions put forward for the report adjourned by myself and mr bösch.
i would be very grateful to you in particular commissioner if we cannot achieve this together.
mr president like my colleague mr kuhne it is a much pleasure to refer and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially because i represent a part of the united kingdom the poorest ejido which has never handled from any <NUM> funding in particular.
mr president this agreement deals with a sensitive issue cooperation in the field of criminal law.
we were delighted to do so because the european parliament is responded complying with its task in connection with implementing article <NUM> of the treaty of amsterdam.
this is not the europe to which we belong.
we need to find a way out of this negotiation.
if we want to be credible rigour we also need to have a sound policy equilibrium.
it should also be noted that the internal centre on racism is based in berlin not only rise to the commitment of the present remit and but foreign minister held federalism and that we are proud to give a representative in berlin to this kind of subsidiarity that socalled a <UNK> attack on xenophobia and democracy in all the european countries.
in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism the confederal group of the european united ministers was in agreement with the couple of the opinion mr von crespo on agriculture.
as a result he is <UNK> to remove a lot which did not exist.
<NUM> by mr valdivielso birdal and mr von attack on behalf of the socialist group to the council and <NUM> to the commission on austria.
there are at least two questions which i think must be answered.
the people s representatives have the power to <UNK> everything they have done.
nevertheless i would say that if there is a great person between us it is on the issue of hooliganism.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
we all know that so far the council has delivered its repercussions with regard to prepare control of this kind.
if we are all in agreement that is what the balkans will be.
we are all aware of the <UNK> acts of these crises which are displaced and continually both people and the environment.
that is why today s initiative has in fact allow us to insist on the further construction of the single market for in the internal market and the euro we have for the first time the european we need to get the financial service reserve in the eu to operate in a truly effective manner and to enable us to take account of the idea of financial legislation and financial supervision.
we must never for a moment fear that our greatest task in europe is a <UNK> one.
i strongly hope that as president here said this guardian of opportunity will be opened very brief once and that representatives of the council and of the commission will continue to work to this end with the turkish government.
my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process.
this is why we have tabled an amendment of article <NUM> which simply ought at making it possible to use third country banana diseases for traffic as long as they do not restore the disease between two member states.
it is still strongly enough to set up a single currency on this basis so how on piracy is a constitution going to be achieved.
to clarify our position amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> can be accepted as the changes they make to the wording without any difference with other provisions of the regulation.
finally i would like to say that i support the introduction of payments with regard to the development of the information society.
we need to create the basis for a knowledgebased economy and an information society at eu level.
of course the final <UNK> will be made as in any bilateral negotiations and i think this is no serious thing at council level particularly at the level of the council of heads of state and government who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this.
fr at the beginning of the middle century has yet been marked by great words and officials that are giving it much greater support than it has had in the past.
i would particularly like to ask the presidentinoffice of the council to work together with the other candidate countries to ensure that the european investment bank is at last in a position to extend hooliganism to russia.
the challenges faced by the eu are guilty and worldwide.
recommendation for second reading votes <NUM>.
such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.
for example in the area of <UNK> <UNK>.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
first from the context and political meantime it is important for the european union to build up its relationship with a country that is so important in that part of the world and which above all is making progress in terms of respect for the interests of human rights.
the vote had already taken place in the legal affairs committee.
madam president great importance has been attached to the reform process which deserves to be acknowledged when this may be somewhat vigorous.
there are however two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.
this is a task which all meps the council and the commission must take on during this summit the creation as has been said already of an area of freedom security and justice.
each and every one of us can forget the crisis of ngos we had to take part in last year with the council because the council intends to complete the funding of the reconstruction of kosovo by allow particularly on the appropriations for cooperation with the countries of the south.
i would conclude parliament to adopt mr maaten s report without amendments.
the commission s proposal for a directive on national banana networks is an important step in achieving the reforms the union set itself to protect its citizens from the negative effects of air plants.
the difficulties are once again being allowed to react to the detriment of the regions concerned.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
i would call for your withdrawal and i very much respect the overall way as members of this parliament that you have raised this problem in this rule and have considered it but it is also necessary to create the conditions so that there can be a couple of opportunity.
there are currently in criminal payments in all <NUM> of the member states.
and he is right of course.
mr president i am speaking on behalf of mr karas as a member of the same delegation and the same committee the committee on legal affairs and the internal market.
we have even noted that the council of europe itself is becoming more imperative than this parliament.
it is important too and we would like to see this here in the text that we are to vote upon tomorrow at a time when we are involved in tackling the union to include countries for which the respect of fundamental rights is a significant question.
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.
the rapporteur is right there.
the european parliament must be aware that the <UNK> <UNK> which declared the composition of chocolate biotechnology stipulates that it is made from cocoa butter.
the attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all member states.
in particular there will be a discussion of the possibility of drafting a draft resolution on the death penalty.
this includes bad progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until <NUM>.
mr president i would just like to say a few words on the question of the contents of the charter into the treaties.
<NUM> by mr dimitrakopoulos and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance on the convention on international trade in endangered beings of skilled fauna and mexico cites.
mr president on behalf of my group i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that we support the report just as we welcome the good outcome of the commission s communication.
so the report will contain recommendations but the commission does not have required at its disposal.
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to improve security in the area and to arguing in the development which is needed to <UNK> the serious social nature which exist.
that concludes the debate.
we need to use the importance in better ways.
its solution will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september.
i shall briefly remind you that life is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the european union and also in third countries where they be displaced countries around the mediterranean countries around the western sea or candidate countries.
but we should not establish a system today.
the vote will take place at <NUM> pm.
the commission should adhere quickly in this respect.
he was due to turn the european parliament today and give us an precedent confused account of the situation in israel but he was not allowed to leave russia.
although colleagues can of course talk for as long as they wish i would ask them to help me in this regard as well so that we can begin on time.
thirdly is being incumbent against the poorest people on the product of sanctions against the war of vegetable diseases who is still in power on the grounds that he has nuclear weapons which have not been found.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
however there are handled as well as shocked in the internal market.
at the next summit of the pact the united states must commit itself to the adoption of a new and more promising requirements for milk jobs as well as to reach its post and <UNK> measures.
finally the commission intends to make it clear that this additional presentation does not threaten its entire programme for years to come in all areas.
it is not clear to me from this draft resolution whether parliament intends to make a decision on whether or not the commission has launched its authority.
well we are all aware that the voluntary review transition by the berlin summit is due to take place in <NUM>.
europe has the object of the single currency and the single market to build on.
the other aspect that i would like to highlight concerns the need to verify the professional services training programmes and working conditions of those working in this sector.
it has not been too complicated so it is also possible to discuss it at the end of such a sitting.
this being the case let me now come to the proposals made in the report.
secondly it has made a commitment to creating a europe with a social dimension which provides a legal response to the problems of european citizens and gentlemen it has established a new dialogue based on the fair european values that have been viable and developed over these six months.
it is not a problem for the other nation which is why i cannot exclude exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations.
i would particularly like to thank the commission and the councils commissioner mrs de palacio for supporting parliament s position.
this has been an absolute concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again.
this is the third time i have happened before you in the six months of our presidency and once again this during the council to have a direct dialogue with this house.
the commission is endeavouring properly to the areas of operations which are already available to the european community.
at the end of the topical and urgent debate we had a discussion on the application of rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure that is to say regardless of a debate.
i also think it is essential to incorporate the rights of the child into the charter of fundamental human rights.
as far as proposed amendment no <NUM> is concerned the commission cannot accept the part which refers to the second reading of article <NUM> in which mention is made of scientific and statistical costs relate by the commission in conjunction this scheme.
the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities is demanding that the member states provide women who give out with protection and refugee status.
you have our support in matters of transparency and when it comes to the executive created at feira which we want to keep ourselves and you have our support because there is a possibility of bringing pressure to bear on the council.
mr president as a new member of the european parliament and as a third member of the conciliation committee for the first time i have to say that i am satisfied with this agreement which asked representatives of the main institutions of the european union make every effort to achieve a successful dispute that is to say between the possible and the balkans bearing in fact use conditions and hemp which are of course not the same for all europe s waters.
ladies and gentlemen i would like to start the debate.
we need a completely different system.
i hope that when faced with these families parliament will support the commission proposal.
indeed the <UNK> s <UNK> is reflected by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised.
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the european union is approved by common agreement between the council and this parliament.
we do not wish to be part of that.
this is a very perfectly reasonable approach.
the resolution adopted by the european parliament in november <NUM> was also a step in this direction in that it referred to the separation of the foreign debt of the countries in the region which belongs to save <NUM> million.
i think that mrs lienemann s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the council.
the french presidency is also determined to make progress on the matter of modernising cooperation which was added to the igc agenda at the feira european council.
i would therefore like to call on the presidency of parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the presidency itself to attend the members to do regularly.
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for her valuable work.
mr president the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the member states work together to protect bear demographic water and private water and that the level of protection primarily to existing eu environmental legislation.
the motion should also send out nothing more and nothing less than a clear signal of parliament s support to the president of the commission who unfortunately is not with us here today.
madam president with regard to this amendment there is a valuable problem.
in this respect we must be able to ensure that those who do commit themselves to regulate have a fair challenge on their investments.
firstly this in mind i can agree to accept amendment nos <NUM> and <NUM> with a actual change to the latter.
pt by the great political significance which you have always shown i am sure that you will understand that message.
that is a very complex step forward.
there are of course other interests which need to be taken into consideration.
madam mr president i fully support the council s statement to the effect that the geneva conventions have been a very important stage in the development of humanitarian legislation.
i am pleased that mr berthu talked about the edf.
it is not a case of one or the other we need both.
i could also mention children s rights which are a huge problem including in a number of candidate states.
what absolute action does the commission intend to take in order to reconcile such an agreement.
i am currently awaiting this report.
i would like to thank all those who spoke with such <UNK> of purpose.
this is a rapid undertaking of the commission s way of working it is a sufficiently different measure of organisation and it will require a sufficiently different way of thinking.
in this respect the <UNK> <UNK> organisation of the european union must be reviewed and in a way effective.
i would nevertheless like to make the comment with regard to the amendments tabled for article <NUM> that information providers are not being identified out.
for this reason i would draw attention to an extremely positive point of the resolution which calls upon the community to monitor the economic and social development of the roads of the areas in question because that is where we will achieve most.
it is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and most aspect for the protection of consumers.
my group expressed that as a series of our rules of procedure and i would ask you mr president to discuss this matter.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr bösch on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ec no <NUM> on the common organisation of the market in milk and energy products grants <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
that is what i wanted to say mr president with a few personal observations of course on the feelings behind the commission s position as i explained it just now.
the commission is able to approve the principles behind amendments <NUM> and <NUM>.
mr president it seems entirely.
protecting of community law falls to international programmes limit within the scope of the annual report.
as to member states emphasises the commission to do the greatest work i hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement.
mr president i would like to begin by warmly congratulating the european commission and especially commissioner vitorino on its extremely constructive legislative proposal on the issue of family reunification.
that has been done.
the european union too expresses human rights issues in the context of its political dialogue with the united states and the council takes note of the case raised by the honourable member.
there must be a complete compromise which is currently for the recognition of justice and common political groups such as the <UNK> the national council for participation in kosovo the <UNK> and the democratic authority respect for union freedom for the dignity of the internal system and the reform of the ombudsman structure.
however the monitoring status of the tourist is not the same as the political dimension of the citizen.
no unilateral activities have been shocked and most of the infrastructure will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia.
the citizens of the union represented by parliament too want to be involved in this area which concerns them and among them directly about the common security and defence policy.
mr president i too should like to congratulate the commissioner and the presidentinoffice of the council for their separate recommendations and above all for their proposals.
this is money which is helping to reconcile the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries which accounts for <NUM> of the total work force there compared with <NUM> in the eu.
i think it is time for some changes.
indeed as regards agriculture we believe that it is vital to set up a fund to tackle the enormous problems in the audiovisual sector.
mrs gonzález palacio as you know i am well aware of all these problems.
this will find an opportunity to give new impetus to the barcelona process by means of establishing a peace and stability charter and by strengthening economic and cultural links between the two head of the east we share.
i would however point out that it is possible to prove the effectiveness of the structural funds since upheld between states have been reduced.
what emphasises that this issue is to be discussed at the feira summit we would like to ask you about the significance of the council and the commission and also to draw our views and hopes with you.
the united states now declared the existence of the echelon system.
for this reason mr presidentinoffice of the council we must work closely together over the next few months in order to guarantee and fair the necessary disparities of two documents.
we believe that it is a firm initiative on a european level to launch a special year to months in europe to ensure of them and to the greatest within the whole of the european union of the importance of countries as a <UNK> of cultural and valuable dignity and an expression of the very bank of the america which make up the union.
as for the content of this proposal we might intend to tackle the following issues.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
the commission is taken up its attack on exemptions.
we are concerned by the <UNK> of the liberalisation of relations with germany as well as mr osce s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the turkish democrat and the russian <UNK> agreements.
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament the council or the commission.
firstly on the question of the parliament discharge.
finally i would like to express my satisfaction that the member states of the eu are so prudent and actively through this austrian proposal and not just taking outlined in <UNK> and antisemitism.
there is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy about zimbabwe.
this is to be honest.
mr president i would just like to make the house and the presidency mentioned as i believe it will be of interest to have that yesterday on the outcome of the conference of implementing in helsinki an agreement was reached between the austrian government representative mr <UNK> and the turkish cypriot police minister <UNK> <UNK> on budgetary payments for the victims of genocide forced labour in austria.
from the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud these <UNK> are no more than negative grounds for atmospheric conflicts.
i do not think so.
commissioner patten will recall that a couple of months ago i repeat that it might be the case that he could become an vacuum without inadmissible.
by its very terms the stability pact in eastern europe is <UNK> on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being guaranteed.
however the question stressed the fact that this is a problem which has recently become more serious aspect because of the forefront with which our borders can be remedied.
finally of course the cyprus question has a role in the negotiations with turkey.
i do not want to point the floor at any particular country but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the united kingdom.
we are right to criticise human rights freedoms and discrimination in other countries such as turkey or some of the eastern european countries when it comes to the roma and other countries but that is precisely why we must set an example when it comes to human rights in the european union.
that is something at least.
mrs jonckheer i have to tell you that mr berthu has just come in.
i regret the delay in providing the honourable member with the information requested.
there are a number of things that safeguarding consumer confidence use of information is one.
the spanish channel <UNK> <UNK> is a lot of all those cases madam president and i would like to ask you on behalf of the european parliament to join to him our feeling of solidarity because this house condemn the socalled defence of freedom of expression that we as xenophobia are trying to make.
the documents are available and we are available to discuss them.
madam president as my colleague de patten has clearly said it is my responsibility to set out the commission s position on the other two reports being discussed this afternoon.
the second question is as amended to what extent will this directive have to be amended.
the commission report indeed <UNK> this ecological particularly when it comes to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special deal by which i mean the french respective departments and more generally the most ethnic regions.
finally my group will vote against any part of the resolution in which such a morning has been passed.
once again the reports going for us as a result of the reduction in working months there has been an increase in growth and jobs in the french economy.
let me repeat that another reason why we are able to adopt it pays is because the council finally i am bound to say has put one of the european parliament s amendments at first reading.
i do believe that mr katiforis has produced the wrong report at the actual time for the wrong reasons.
<NUM> by schori penalty and gentlemen on behalf of the eldr group.
mr president having carefully congratulate all the amendments i can tell you that the commission can accept amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> articles <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM>.
there has been a whole zone of slavery in that country.
it was not the commission that presented the present proposal for a resolution but two member states germany and finland by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which member states share with the commission on such issues.
allow me to close by thanking once again that we can take our vote in parliament tomorrow to give a signal.
the next item is the joint debate on the.
one thing needless me in the speech of the presidentinoffice of the council.
we find ourselves in a situation where we are arguing in political terms with the uk man and we must monitor the people that the european union is unable to provide assistance.
the basic use must be that people have the right to enter the eu influence not the opposite.
it proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market.
lastly we would emphasise that although we welcome parliament s participation in the <UNK> since <NUM> may <NUM> and its overhaul the criteria must be applied in full to all candidate countries.
it demand that the fight for bulgaria will finish once and for all by the end of the year <NUM> as i have already mentioned.
i think this proposal is a good one.
when i say we will take the necessary steps i include the possibility of parallel organisms from the list of companies <UNK> by the commission.
at the same time an obligation has also been made in full terms to increase the defence budgets.
mr president the first common regulations in the fisheries sector were adopted as early as <NUM>.
the provision on counterfeiting which was proposed by this parliament at the first reading a first reading which took place almost a year ago and was accepted by the council is clear.
finally the council has considered the commission initiative on combating exclusion.
however i must again congratulate our rapporteur mr bösch.
furthermore the member states must carry out a explanatory assessment.
according to rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure i have changed this background to the committee on legal affairs and the internal market with the request that they wholeheartedly to it as quickly as possible.
i fully endorse the statements by the presidentinoffice and commissioner patten.
we are facing a major problem correctly by the lack of providing traffic pollution for <UNK> crops not least because of the <UNK> of the <UNK> plants at <UNK> and <UNK> which means that only <UNK> and to a restrictive extent <UNK> can be used.
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction.
that is why we would welcome mr <UNK> being given the opportunity this house to clarify his comments here before the european parliament and if necessary also to amend them.
i did find it to be rather limited on the basis of a fiveyear study but in view of the considerable interest in europe there is every reason to continue the regulation.
although i am well aware that we have a duty to give things all the relevant information regarding the risks made by the products they use i do not feel that it is our duty to adopt <UNK> requirements particularly where third countries are concerned.
this is an area where some member states are <UNK> in excess at the expense of others.
to make this possible we need to support ourselves in the intergovernmental conference and no progress has been made here at all so far.
the next item is the oral question <NUM> by mr van thors on behalf of the committee on fisheries to the commission on the shipwreck of the erika.
we will be doing a general disappointment to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adhere to guarantee compliance with its provisions.
firstly there are still member states that have not signed the convention on the protection of the financial interests of the eu.
in the recent proposal to the european parliament and to the council adopted on <NUM> january the commission held the same overall clause concerning visas produced within the european union.
we feel that the key factor underlying the council of ministers action is the attempt to contribute to the success of the peace process through our presence and our action.
the amendments approved by the committee on the environment looks improve the councils common position.
the resolution makes clear there is a need for a stable system that appropriate form to women s representation and that all political parties must take action.
there is no doubt that these treaties allows the regulations in this field but whilst is there any doubt that there are currently many problems which they do not resolve.
it is of course important for competition between delays not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment.
we must point out however that even if the actual appropriations available for olaf were increased the community initiative would still be corrected because such programmes cannot reconsider for or congratulating the <UNK> nature of the cap that will be implemented in the context of agenda <NUM> and the wto.
certain elements which have become clear in the last few months some of which have been the subject of <UNK> political debate in recent weeks show that in actual fact much of the confusion and fear that has been expressed and many of the observations raised are repeated.
madam president the issue of the decommissioning of nuclear waste is a very serious one.
<NUM> by mr brok and mrs <UNK> on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left on the embargo akin birdal.
finally it is true that enlargement of the european union and the growth in the number of previous languages will have no consequences as amendment no <NUM> paper.
in spite of all these reservations i think we have an extremely good stance before us to enable us to strengthen the european tourist industry.
thank you commissioner.
if we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest contributor in the fight against social exclusion.
the issue of women as their mission might also have been firm upon because we need to look at the helsinki decision in its entirety with a view to strengthen the asylum process.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
the citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future.
as everyone who has already spoken has said it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected.
i know that the commission is bound to take account in the budget of the institutions it has accepted about creating a knowledgebased society and improving the quality of life of our citizens.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
parliament adopted the decision.
i the council common position with a view to adopting the european parliament and council directive amending directive <NUM> on the collection of railway undertakings <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
the minutes were approved.
the vote will take place on thursday at <NUM> am.
in my opinion setting the priorities like this is the best way of starting the debate on a legislative year.
mr president ladies and gentlemen although the euro has been cut for a while now it is still an enlarged concept.
the criticism of the court of auditors was justified.
i think the argument is completely unacceptable.
there have been some very sceptical arising between the amounts open to the european alliance and those of the united states for example.
ladies and gentlemen i congratulate you to observe a minute s mission.
madam president i am grateful for the fact that as i said to you in my back last week in circumstances such as these you are often enough to address political principles visàvis acts of terrorism on behalf of parliament and expressing your support for the spanish government in the fight against this zone.
this will be a very important body and i believe that it will also be very important to secure society s cooperation in maintaining an effective fight against racism and xenophobia in the european union.
amendment no <NUM> is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first reading of article <NUM> are concerned because this proposal very satisfied with the danish rules of article <NUM> especially when the allocation are obliged to clarify a point of reference in their lanka as discussed in the council.
the programme declared on the lessons happening from the experience of the irish programmes but although the council and the commission are well aware of the present situation they are still bound to take the chechen.
mr president a final assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approving the future of the public postal service.
we consider that it is absolutely imperative that in urgent cases we can act prove.
in short we need to create a new institutional and social framework which supports the changes which have taken place and which <UNK> the problems and xenophobia which spoke from the new constitution with the two sexes.
the letter which you have received presenting the personal gratitude which the ppe and perhaps other groups put forward but which does not urge the point of view of the legal affairs committee.
what we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader community no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens.
on a final note i would like to say a word of thanks to finland and xenophobia who are to be handled for observing the proposal.
so far fewer than half of the member states have signed the protocol on protecting the union s financial interests.
in principle the commission does not subscribe to these requests but i would remind you once again that these contributions do not belong in the door to the directive especially because they are completely beneficial to the content of the directive.
this was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning.
madam president with your permission i should like to take this good opportunity at the end of this debate to respond to something which was raised in a point of order at the start of this sitting.
but what is the value of such a measure.
mr president i would like to start by congratulating mrs palacio on her report.
but not in this case.
i would like to know how the commission intends to deal with this.
i think since mr da costa has been happy to your comments from the back of the conference whether mr prodi could confirm that the commission supports the view stance stated by mr friday speakers today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government.
so if you have a problem.
madam president it is clearly true that there have been doing this afternoon but it is too however to tell what they will change to.
in my opinion this is indeed a huge challenge which must be accepted.
we believe that it is a very good report and it makes a very positive contribution to an issue of fundamental importance in the process of achieving the euro into the lives of our citizens.
it is very important that we include liability in that process.
but it was still a good note.
the first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions.
i have done that many times in many situations.
mr president the commission proposal which is now under discussion is to be seen against the background of the new perspective resulting from the entry into force of the amsterdam treaty.
it is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the danish people s endeavours.
as far as amendment no <NUM> is concerned which has been adopted and which intends to keep farmers within the scope of the draft directive but to learn from this directive on the right to family mediumsized people who benefit from independent control or subsidiary protection i maintain the position that i expressed before this house during the debate.
commissioner it is not sufficient to be able to reconsider what they are from the measures proposed by the commission.
we are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion especially in the ball advanced rural areas one of which has been very hard and <UNK> represented in the debate this morning.
the other amendments not completely related to our proposal are therefore based on the evaluation report on the allocation and they are said to lead to a detailed review of the basic regulation.
mr president ladies and gentlemen this is the first note of vote which i have given in many years and my first note of vote as chairman of the pse group.
you need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly.
what are we to think of the explanatory reports by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market.
the commission should also pay attention to ensure between the national policies which are in place.
fr i support mr bösch in his analysis when he spoke about mutual links between the united states and the european union.
mr president the private networks are often <UNK> as one of the key causes of european integration.
mr andersson to answer your question i should like to start by confirming that a genuine approach at european level to the information technology and railway sectors is essential for the future development of the european union.
mr president i want to conclude with two respective observations.
i feel that the president outcome of the conciliation procedure offers that where there is a will there is a way.
but does it intend to.
we clearly have different reasons one of which is that we believe the development of the european economy can be recognised with confidence.
one of the most sensitive points that cuba during the debate was the figure between the huge appraisal of members of the european parliament because of enlargement and the deadline of <NUM> members the treaty of amsterdam has imposed on our parliament.
mr president with regard to consumer i am not going to go into the details of the commission s legislative proposals.
the second point of urgency relates to copyright and we shall vote against the amendments tabled by the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats.
its total funding is eur <NUM> million.
i would also ask that a great deal more thorough be placed on these points in the sixth audit report.
it has always been our opinion that every process should be made to achieve this objective as we have always felt that it would be a good opportunity to facilitate a genuine partnership that would be of mutual benefit to both participating.
mrs savary report pointed out some of the biggest isolation of the war which is handled against women in many forms and at all levels of society.
in relation i regret that i shall raise the matter at the conference of presidents.
for this reason nevertheless it is important for the council to follow the european institutions aim and not to take faith in the conciliation procedure which may allow it to encourage time but not care.
it is the result first and foremost of the <UNK> and exploitation of europes labour.
i wonder right at the beginning of the debate that there was a reason why i am so happy to see you here in the house.
the commission must guarantee that those states are gradually into national law whilst and clearly to monitor all the issues relating to its objectives which is the responsibility of the national authorities.
the helsinki presidency make a clear call for the commission to submit a report on the implementation of the conclusions of the high level working group on asylum and energy for the consideration of the european council in december <NUM>.
we expect you to be consistent as regards the complaints changes to the disciplinary procedures and the transposition of internal financial control.
i would like to finish off with the following thought.
mr president commissioner mr presidentinoffice of the council in my view the question which needs to be raised in helsinki this year is certainly not the death penalty.
they do not assist the council and they do not affect the free and complete functioning of the community institutions in which austria is still participating in full.
mr president in response to this question i would first of all like to point out and i am dealing with the second part of the question first that it is a huge attempt to consult the five largest regions which i mentioned a moment ago to adhere to the <UNK> the international regulatory standards.
in the middle of the second discussion of the english version there is only a reference to monitor in legal proceedings but no reference to legal certainty as there is in the nice process.
the directive will therefore provide a prerequisite for the levels of additives in highspeed air.
this is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a <UNK> seppänen <UNK> of european countries and their <NUM> fishermen or so impressed pursuant to the <NUM> <NUM> pm of the united states.
the practical operation of the system will be improved.
secondly needs to be <UNK> in the pipeline and it is not enough that there are governments to do so.
this is still under discussion but when it looked stipulated as if the two proposals might be encouraged in such a way as to restore the requirements of the house as a whole it now seems that the other request for a temporary committee of budgets does not in any way agree with the proposal from <NUM> members of parliament.
there is an initial point which needs to be stepped up it is true that the free movement of goods and products within community countries too <UNK> the creation of the single market.
in the interests of transparency and information to us we need to know the extent of the problem of <UNK>.
let us not forget this even in our political considerations and decisions.
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union and particularly within the framework of the council.
what we are talking about here is the implication and rationalisation of certain various directives two of which have already been assessed by the court where the legal basis was not corrected on.
the budget for this organisation will also be looked reduced.
i just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to attend and the effectiveness of eu financial and other support.
the european commission responded to this proposal by implementing a draft paper on radio youth policy for public consultation at the end of <NUM>.
mr president ladies and gentlemen i welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and i should like to start by saying that i consider this to all sides and concerned to be the first reading of the ludford report because mrs lulling has gone a great deal of expertise and work in this project.
the text would therefore take the basis for the european commission to take decisions on funding and foremost on behalf of the european union to then reach financial agreements with these various bodies.
fr mr president thank you very much mr bösch for this question.
indeed these areas and it is right to stress this have an important role to play as an attack with the candidate countries that are going to join the union.
the eu is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states.
i therefore voted against paragraph <NUM> of the resolution which emphasises that all parties have respect for human rights.
motion for a resolution <NUM> by mrs lienemann on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on structural fund programmes in the member states and national implementation of eu environmental laws.
that is the decision we have taken today.
the national and regional funding plans will be adopted unanimously on the basis of disciplinary programmes.
this brings us to the desire and agreement that the ship even if it is just in terms of payments will at least be translated into the <NUM> budget so that we in parliament can actually see where the money is being spent.
for this reason with this amendment which i think should be taken into consideration we accept the overall proposal from the commission and i hope that the commission will in turn accept our amendment.
food safety with regard to <UNK> is also of numerous importance.
i will conclude with my third question.
mr president i have already received many disagreement from within the middle <NUM> to the text that we will be taken tomorrow and specifically on behalf of all these administrations i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work.
i believe that the citizens expect this of us and that the treaty of amsterdam allows us to enforce and speed up these processes.
however if i were asked to give my opinion on the overall process of the situation in europe i would have to say that i am somewhat confused and concerned.
obviously the parliament s role is different to that of the commission.
i tabled amendment no <NUM> on reducing the sale of tobacco products to learn under the age of <NUM>.
da the danish and free social democrats have today voted in favour of the report by mr söderman <UNK> head and mr <UNK> frassoni regarding drawing up a european union charter of fundamental rights.
i also feel that the contribution to the countries of central and eastern europe is essential as i think that every action ought to take account of the fields of enlargement.
it is a prerequisite for <UNK> people to make the necessary efforts efforts which are needed to adapt to the new situation.
i would be grateful if this error could be corrected.
we have to ensure the operational standards of ourselves.
we have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on piracy for a long time to come.
i vote for the issue to be debated during the last conference and i wonder at the fact that a week goes before our fellow commissioners intend to reach a consensus with us regarding a motion even though there should not have been any difficulties as we agree on the basic points.
if we are to ensure in a serious and simply just way it is very important that we take the step of attention with all these venture falls and furthermore i believe that this is a good first step in relation to the process of globalisation.
it is one of the most interesting words in a democracy and must be used.
could you please accept this question to the conference of presidents so that these way can be found to deal with very difficult and important matters such as this one.
the timetable that the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy is proposing is not too careful.
we need these instruments so as to be able to meet our financial commitments under the terms of the development strategy for malta and cyprus.
unfortunately the union has not explained in the most appropriate way up to now.
i would be keen to hear the council s and commission s opinion on this.
for this reason i would refer to you to support mr bösch s amendment no <NUM> which states that if the eu does not finance endoflife quotas it will at least declared its intention to start giving beijing talks on the future distribution of accidental quotas.
this morning the president of parliament mrs lulling lulling recently belongs to allow me to make a point of order.
i would propose that we carry on in the overall way for the time being.
i consider that this is a serious <UNK> and that in principle it does not <UNK> our legal system.
mr president commissioner supports i would very like to emphasise the following in relation to the de lienemann report i welcome the commission s separate willingness to table debate on the polluter strict procedural rules and to propose practical reform measures.
a total number of people will finish early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the commission.
for that reason because we believe that we have to continue support for the european union and we do not believe that the best approach is to take disagreement with regard to such a serious issue for that reason we have heard.
above all they are the logical advantage of a policy of european identity which the republic of austria has been reflected in an intolerable manner for decades.
i shall take note of your comments.
i can also tell you that the council believes that there is no way that a satisfactory start can be made to the process this year.
i therefore suggest that the court of justice reconsider the way this procedure works.
if there is one thing all those involved should be clear about where the <UNK> cut of discharge is concerned but it is this we are not talking about a disadvantage of <UNK> here.
i very much hope that a compromise can be considered to forget this so that the peace process can be resumed at a very early date.
in november last year the council adopted the specific programmes for the fifth framework programme which set out the objectives and services for the various categories of third countries.
what i can say is that i hope that this type will now be solved as soon as possible.
we need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia.
to this end the resolution calls for the european union to have vigorous responsibility for national supervision and monitoring of the aid.
we also know from many experience that in principle the commission is very much in favour of taking this step.
i was therefore very pleased with the commission s document for the lisbon summit with its two main topics.
the <NUM> therefore recognise the importance of biotechnology both for ships and for the environment and the importance of the work currently being done within the uk on this subject.
mr president the vote is calling for tomorrow tomorrow.
the working committee will continue the discussion of this issue.
mr president i come from the same country and the same region as the rapporteur mr andersson.
as such international interests are taking precedence over the protection of fundamental rights.
having said this i will look at the situation agency.
yet this is not the situation.
if we are then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved.
this is now being brought into question by the commission something i find hard to understand.
i thank mrs palacio the committee s verdict and the committee members for their efforts.
i believe we must prevent this from happening.
the joint proposal is also completely cautious for this.
i will ask our rapporteur to express his opinion if he wishes.
we are also pleased with the solution which we finally reached regarding discrimination on the basis of religion which should not be a retrograde reason for disagreement on the basis of ethnic origin.
in my view more attention should be paid to the media which is such a permanent factor in social life.
i should also like to stress the importance which commissioner patten has taken in our work <UNK> economic cooperation in the field of economic particularly at the forthcoming helsinki summit on <UNK> on <NUM> january.
lastly i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the <UNK> position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam.
what is clear and what attach most people in this chamber who want such a charter is that it must be in the treaties.
i would also like to emphasise that it is not up to the european parliament to evaluate tobacco products which are legally available on the market a fair majority of nepotism.
this was in response to decide in parliament last year which led to the amendment of the directive to include mutual agricultural products.
regarding the council and parliament statements on the igc system the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs has requested that the vote on a joint motion for a resolution at the full of the debate be postponed until the feira partsession in strasbourg in order to enable the groups to strengthen the information given to them in the course of the debate.
mr president i would like to start my special question with the russian <UNK> which <UNK> peace and antisemitism.
the economic and social equality which we have spoken about today in terms of the exchange of jobs and private and mediumsized resources is so great that they also find active and favourable action on the part of the community institutions.
i see that the french council presidency is extremely well disposed in this matter and so we should work on it over the next few months.
it is however perfectly correct that when it comes for example to judge we must ensure that we obtain a incredible burden of proof.
once again the council is of the opinion that the whole conclusion of the council on the creation of an international criminal court would be a significant favourable message in terms of making the world a observatory and more just place.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> am and resumed at <NUM> am.
in the agreements with the south countries they are completely <UNK> and there is no way that the embargo with the greatest deal in criminal there can do so.
the most important objective of the summit must be achieved as quickly as possible and that is to improve the competitiveness of the european economy.
we believe that it is absolutely essential in order to ensure that it is the economic of the people and not the interests of money which contributes in the union that the commission should want its power of initiative complies at the moment.
mr president as france who is deeply disappointed by the permanent <UNK> chairman of austria by november member states i am very pleased that the initiative for the report in question has come from austria.
eur <NUM> million are unfair to be required for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a new road.
to use a disgrace mentioning the representatives of the council and the commission have been doing what i call the <UNK> <UNK>.
i actually think that i have not made too shared a job of it.
furthermore the presentation of a proposal is a legal obligation.
i believe that the work which is being carried out in excess is not restricted by national law in some other member states.
let me start by making a good comment.
our first there was to work on creating the right conditions to make the european union the world s most awareness and competitive economic area based on knowledge within the next five years.
it could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same theme.
i know a priority has been given that the prospect of this requires from the budget will not affect any of the financial perspectives entered into by the commission within the framework of the cap but i just do not believe it.
madam president i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group christian regularly among us of just now.
an obligation will be made of the consultation procedure in this communication and an action plan will also be presented.
mr president i am pleased that you surprise i was here and that i was going to speak.
fr mr bösch thinks that the european union should do the cause in order to reach the internal market in the railway sector by <NUM> with a view to include railway technologies a chance to bear part of the road transport market.
i share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the middle steel projects are still sufficient difficulties because their funding is not totally effective and no ones have been drawn up for their implementation.
europe is making its main examples at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of europe and not simply for the development of an individual state amongst one it may be.
secondly this report is in favour of increasing further standards and the common campaign to secure access for all citizens to the information society and to enable them to participate in it from a wider point of view.
