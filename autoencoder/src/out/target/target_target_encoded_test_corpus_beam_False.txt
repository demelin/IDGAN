however in the sphere of public broadcasting it is essential to remember that in accordance with the amsterdam protocol in the system of public broadcasting in member states it is up to each member state to specify the financial and organisational structure of public service broadcasting.
you have seen yourself as the guardian of the treaties and that is indeed your role.
the common position is a definite improvement on the commissions proposal.
the debate is closed.
what i mean to say is that in any event i share the commission s concern and i think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one.
which is why it is all the more important for us to create stable foundations for a european approach whilst always upholding the principle of subsidiarity of course.
access to the work of the european group on ethics and their opinions is an important of the general evaluation.
still relating to thursday s sitting the ppe group has requested that mrs cederschiöld s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to wednesday as the last item on the agenda.
the vote will be totally distorted.
on behalf of the commission commissioner patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.
this demonstrates the essential role of the monitoring centre as a support mechanism for the decisionmaking process.
it gives an account of the activities of the euro system during <NUM> and at the beginning of this year.
there should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.
i am glad that this point is made in the report.
the fact is if the european union intends to fight for alternative rules for international trade if it is to defend the european farm model then it must acknowledge that there is still a lot to be done in order to put its political decisions into practice.
the report shows that in general they are a long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita.
we feel that railway undertakings should have access to the entire network of the fifteen member states in five years time for both international and national freight traffic and by <NUM> for international and national passenger traffic.
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost as soon as possible to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the member states and european union policies are coordinated and complementary.
<NUM> by mr marset campos on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left on the situation in fiji and the solomon islands.
i remind you that greece as well as germany and france are countries that belong to the schengen area.
it has never been taken up <UNK>.
de mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen first of all i want to sincerely thank all those who helped me draft this report and especially the committee members for adopting it unanimously.
firstly the need for a rapid revision of the legal instruments governing the sector in particular the television without frontiers directive which has been in need of revision for a long time.
we expect the european union to continue negotiations maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round.
the main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a european public.
we very much hope that the council will side with parliament in this matter and that we will in fact be able to retain this employment initiative.
rather i want to be assessed on the basis of my performance and not on the basis of my gender.
we must consider the alternatives at the end of the process.
i can see a certain contradiction and i am concerned and i believe i speak for the rest of the committee on employment and social affairs as well that behaviour within the commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory.
i urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution.
i believe that in accordance with article <NUM> <NUM> we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the commission and i would therefore urge my fellow meps to decide in favour of referral back to committee.
given the deficit of protein crops in the european union parliament considers that this system should be improved without cutting the level of aid.
mr president commissioner rapporteur congratulations on your report.
it is true that one cannot attack the causes of migratory flows without talking about human rights.
now the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu.
we must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future particularly with the countries which will be joining us.
the second point of the triangle is social and economic cohesion.
i will end by thanking mr radwan for this excellent report and say that i agree with the greater part of its content.
as i mentioned earlier and i was also speaking for my colleague mr vitorino we see eye to eye on many of the concerns raised by a number of members of this house this morning but this is not an opportune moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the monitoring centre itself.
i would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment or to put it another way projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.
we have spelt this out again and again and also made it very clear in mr van hulten s report of <NUM> january in paragraphs <NUM> and <NUM> to be precise.
mr president i do not want to delay the proceedings i just want to ask the bureau to consider refusing to accept any more motions for deletion in the future which delete entire paragraphs so that we can avoid the problem which has arisen today.
this is not enough.
there is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions and more research is being done on the effects of <UNK> on human health and the environment.
i should like to ask you the diplomatic language of your reply notwithstanding whether or not you consider that turkey should make moves in order to meet the requirements of the helsinki resolutions and what you think these moves might be.
i will try to reply briefly although these are complex questions and i will therefore have to give this point some attention.
just as we agreed with the <NUM> amendment and for the same reasons we are going to support these amendments in the terms proposed by the commission.
this study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.
mr president there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.
this is true if we think of russia s plans in the <UNK> but at the start of your mandate a few months ago you yourself announced at the conference of presidents that you would however be presenting a legislative programme or rather the major policy lines of the european government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.
however i would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which <UNK> down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments.
in addition to that there is the question of dutyfree.
proposing new standards has a huge impact on the european aviation industry as a whole.
the liberalisation of this sector must under no circumstances be an obstacle to this access.
mr president commissioner guaranteeing public health is the objective of one of today s most important areas of legislation.
in view of the limited amount of time available to us all allow me to mention just two.
mr president the report by mr papayannakis we are discussing is an important tool to improve consumer protection and increase consumer confidence in food in europe.
i would ask the commission to pay more attention to this aspect.
mr barón crespo i can tell you that following the letter written to me by mr wurtz i have already drafted a letter to the tunisian authorities stating what you and mr wurtz wanted.
the middle east.
mr president i should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the association of parliamentary assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
it is important mr president ladies and gentlemen that we do not create another species of human being in the same way that we appear to be provoking natural and environmental disasters.
the council finally presented its proposal.
we must ensure that the european union is not replaced by a poor quality counterfeit which would leave our states vulnerable to crossborder crime and which would be to the detriment of its inhabitants.
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology ie the correct way to quote.
we will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail.
in its effort to develop the european military capability the eu must take into account the need to maintain a relationship of cooperation dialogue and consultation with european allies who are not members of the european union and with the applicant countries.
the netherlands is significantly affected by the european water policy.
mr president after the vote in east timor the process of selfdetermination in western sahara is the last one outstanding in the world.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen having read the commission communication on the interreg iii initiative and pointing out that i took part in the vote on mr decourrière s report within the committee on regional policy transport and tourism i should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and particularly in the context of interreg iii b with the commission s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of <UNK> run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector a sector in which many associations especially <UNK> are already making enormous investments in my own country.
this is not a <UNK> crime.
will the council say whether it intends to raise this matter as part of the preaccession procedure to call on the turkish government to respect the rights of the assyrianchaldean minority in turkey and more particularly to ensure that the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> can continue to operate without hindrance.
it can only be done on the basis of the factual content of a proposal and when it comes to amendments on the basis of the factual content of these amendments.
i believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive.
we believe that the work that has been done and the increasing awareness on the part of the candidate countries of the need to work with the european union during the preaccession period to strengthen control mechanisms combined with collaboration in this field may yield concrete results.
the vote will take place at <NUM> am tomorrow.
however ladies and gentlemen i have taken note of the criticisms and remarks saying that we can do better.
mr president commissioner monti on the subject of the proposal before us i should like to make four remarks or observations on behalf of my group but not without first congratulating our fellow member mrs randzioplath.
this is the european union not the soviet union.
mr president in a world such as this which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation and not only in the economic field our responses in order to be effective must be concerted and coordinated.
you ask how we can best protect our farmers as producers when they do not know what it is that they are feeding their animals.
in what will i stress be purely a point of order on the provisions of our rules of procedure i should like to mention certain matters which are not related to the crux of the issue but which are related to the procedure to be followed in this case which i am sure you will all agree is extremely serious.
mr president i want to congratulate mr varela suanzescarpegna on the amount of work he has put into this indeed into all issues that come before the committee on fisheries.
but thank you for your remarks.
report <NUM> by mrs stauner on behalf of the committee on budgetary control on giving discharge to the commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the european union for the <NUM> financial year <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president in the present joint draft resolution paragraph <NUM> urges the council and member states rightly so to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the un police units.
madam president i have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.
there is a further problem which should also not be hidden from the commission or the members of this house we are talking about the <UNK> enlargement of the european union with thirteen new member states most of which have a far lower average income than that of the poorest regions of the community and there are no plans to fulfil cohesion policies with regard to these candidate member states.
mr president this is a question of democracy.
the visibility of the middle east peace process is not an end in itself for the european union.
the european union cannot continue to turn a blind eye.
therefore some of the <NUM> members have violated the rules of procedure.
<UNK> is a form of renewable energy.
we also think it is good that all forms of organised crime and not only drug trafficking are to be regarded as predicate offences.
madam president you have consulted the legal affairs committee on the basis of a purely formal decision.
so we have absolutely nothing to do with this matter and for that reason i cannot promise any kind of followup action either.
i should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste hierarchy.
as such on behalf of those in my group who welcome this i am strongly in favour of the parts of the report which pertain to this point.
this year we have eur <NUM> <NUM> million.
mr president commissioner i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us after each of our respective political groups has <UNK> together and expressed its feelings finally to produce a joint resolution.
i will pass on your comments to the bureau but as regards the tv system we have considered this question before.
yesterday we discussed this matter and i received the full support of the council for which i would like to publicly express my gratitude.
this is the situation we have if we take the <UNK> nature of the council into due account.
i should like to give mr nogueira román as accurate an answer as possible on this extremely important question which he is not the first to raise ie the application of the principle of additionality during the management and implementation of the structural funds for which i am responsible.
i look forward to the european union taking up these abuses at the un commission on human rights in geneva which i will attend on <NUM> march.
it would therefore be irresponsible of parliament to adopt amendments which could not be accepted by the council.
with regard to cyprus the process for resolving the cypriot problem was launched under the auspices of the united nations.
even though i approve of the general guidelines of interreg iii i feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme financed by the erdf and the other external cooperation funds including in particular the european development fund intended for acp countries.
mr <UNK> spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents which has been debated.
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.
mr president i wish to begin by saying how delighted i am that the presidency is prepared to put some pressure on the governments which in turn i hope will put pressure on their parliaments to proceed with ratification.
i propose that we change this system.
i therefore put mr cox s proposal as accepted by the rapporteur to the vote.
as far as cyprus is concerned it has always been the union s contention that the accession negotiations should benefit the efforts being made to find a solution to the political problem.
if it was then it should not be distributed as an official document.
i do not feel in a position to accept amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM>.
in response to the question put to me by mr hatzidakis i should like to stress the commissions delight at the ambitious scope of greeces regional development plan for the new period <NUM>.
interoperability of the transeuropean rail systems.
i understand your concern mr poettering but i do not wish to get involved in an argument and i hope that your comments are not going to start one.
this may take account of the wishes of the council and of council s decisions but it does not take quite such good account of the wishes of parliament.
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.
if we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support then that is urgently required.
i believe it has a place here.
now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks but what i am really saying to you commissioner and i have said this to you in the fisheries committee and i will say it to you again there is a wide divide between brussels and the working fishermen.
among other things the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in european administrative law so that all citizens of the union receive equal treatment.
the commissions objective in revising the meda regulation is to streamline the decisionmaking process so that we can deliver assistance promptly in line with the political priorities of the european union in the mediterranean.
most of parliament s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to eur <NUM> million must be seen as positive.
this is why i wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on gibraltar on this matter.
there is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in <NUM> and this must not take place one moment sooner.
i regret that at the end of the day only <NUM> members voted for the text and i would like to ask those responsible for the running of this house to check whether the procedure followed really made sense.
i would like to say a few words about the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation because i myself have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with switzerland over the past few years.
they are to be given better opportunities to move and an extended right to take up residence in other countries.
since many of the amendments proposed by the parliament at first reading have been taken into account i personally find that the view of the parliament has been incorporated into the common position to a sufficient extent.
i welcome president prodi to the chamber and i thank him for being present.
the issue of <UNK> herds has been discussed at length.
at this stage this could include for example collaboration between the commission and the political committee the consolidation of community responsibility for nonmilitary crisis management the creation of a council of ministers for defence coordination of the treaty on european union the nato charter and the weu the legal personality of the european union reinforced cooperation in this area as well parliamentary control and lastly financing.
one of the main demands of the demonstrators in seattle was rightly the establishment of this type of tax and this is not by chance.
now following the feira european council and we are delighted that this is the case four issues have been raised and we must reach a substantial agreement on all of them by which i mean all four of these questions and not only concentrate on one or other of them.
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.
on behalf of the socialist group i would like to focus on the point of internal reform.
article <NUM> of the treaty stipulates that the council can entrust the ecb with specific tasks relating to policies on the prudential supervision of credit companies and other financial companies with the exception of insurance companies.
agriculture ought to be placed on an equal footing with other branches of the food industry and compete in a free market.
i feel it must be brought to their attention that the union will become more democratic more transparent and more accessible to them.
i feel i must thank you on behalf of the house for your exhaustive response to the debate.
the internal market is europe s platform in the world.
i am presiding over the meeting according to the agenda as it is before us.
that is why the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has decided to reject any new proposal to liberalise the capital market unless the monti package is first adopted.
the commission proposes a quota of <NUM> <NUM> tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand.
we note with satisfaction that some of the amendments we tabled in the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment were adopted.
indeed this has already been demonstrated on several occasions.
changes always meet resistance in institutions and we should therefore be especially grateful that the rapporteur has wished to draw up this report with the support of the ppe and we hope of the other political groups in parliament.
you are of course quite correct in relation to that.
therefore mr president our proposals which we will specify in another report together with the proposals of the commission which has produced an excellent document and i am happy to be able to say this here to mr barnier are going to be used as conference documents.
this is all i can say.
in accordance with new provisions included in the amsterdam treaty all the <NUM> million consumers within the european union have a right to <UNK> information.
it is therefore evident that this money must be paid back and that this company must not receive any fresh funding.
but i strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the member states ought to take proper account.
article <NUM> of the structural funds regulation adopted on <NUM> june <NUM> provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of violations in the following areas implementation of environmental legislation breaches of public contracts and failure to observe equality between men and women.
in april <NUM> the draft budget submitted by the european commission provided for a <NUM> reduction in that budget line.
on the whole we should therefore be satisfied with the present proposals.
secondly the new convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.
mr president first of all i would like to compliment the commission and also our rapporteur on the agreement reached.
at all events mr president i would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been hugely important.
this is neither the time nor the place to begin a debate on this issue.
as international women s day rapidly approaches i would like to reiterate my support for the action undertaken within the institutions and the member states with a view to promoting women s access to positions of responsibility particularly in politics.
the debate is closed.
parliament adopted the resolution.
there are economic and social implications.
of course the health and wellbeing of our citizens is of paramount importance.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
this has not been the case today.
in view of the forthcoming un conference in new york i think it is opportune that we claim a more active and effective european and worldwide policy in all sectors a policy which will reach as far as afghanistan and the gulf states where women are still in a most unfortunate position and are denied fundamental human rights.
i will submit a more detailed description of the incident shortly but for the time being i would be very grateful if you could make the german authorities aware of the problem.
i therefore hope that this point <NUM> which relates to the exceptional provision of point <NUM> will never need to be applied.
however the commission proposes many other things.
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to start by congratulating mr <UNK> maaten on his firstclass report.
i should like to say that i am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard over such a long period to persuade prime minister jospin to at last grasp the european cause firmly.
it is true that a country such as the netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two.
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about.
i would also like to point out that as well as the effort being made in terms of negotiations between the governments which we must support my political family the socialist international is also trying to support and promote this process because both the israeli and palestinian leaders belong to our family and we feel profoundly committed to them.
however i do want to listen to all the points of view.
i welcome that and i congratulate you.
however the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.
apart from a few exceptions the members of the group of the european people s party will vote in favour of the committee s amendments and of course our own.
the socialist group believes that aid policy must be the <UNK> of the european union s external activities insofar as it reflects the ideas which must inspire the construction of the european union that is to say solidarity and cohesion on a global level.
all that is stated in paragraph <NUM> of the report.
i am not against this increase in principle.
the liberalisation of energy markets is an essential factor in the development of the economy.
i would like to make a few specific recommendations to the <UNK> government.
in addition to the need to have sufficient staff in the commission s directoratesgeneral to cope with the change coordination is also a key area if we are to send a clear message to the public through a wideranging communications strategy with adequate financial resources and an appropriate time frame.
so far there have been no infringements of the law.
the proposal cannot therefore be approved.
i very much hope that more members of the epped group will support this report.
the debate is closed.
in short mrs peijs report is comprehensive and i would like to congratulate her on this.
on the one hand and this is no small thing the process has continued despite the negative factors that have affected the middle east peace process.
with regard to other issues likely to be added to the igc s work an initial debate has been held based on a list drawn up by the council presidency.
thirdly and this is a particularly important point women must be more involved in the world of work.
motion for a resolution <NUM>.
we believe that the drugs monitoring centre is crucial much needed and has a useful role to play in the future of the european union but not by means of this report with which in essence the commission apparently agrees.
it is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion and we ask the commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the european union.
so what we want the european patent office to do is something on behalf of the european commission while the office itself is not a community institution.
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.
i have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the leftovers from amsterdam.
mr president the situation regarding fresh water in europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but in general terms it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> and others on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on russian journalist andrey babitsky.
there are three reasons for this.
i will not go back to the previous debate although i had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter.
secondly there will be a deterioration in the prior conditions of the railways being able to compete with other types of transport.
we hope that the zimbabwean authorities realise that the way these elections are run will of course have a bearing on the credibility of the government itself in the eyes of the international community.
this is not however the case.
i would also point out that i had three minutes in which to speak.
we are now presenting the first progress report or annual report for <NUM> but which in fact summarises the initial implementation period <NUM> and prepares the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period <NUM> in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow member mr valdivielso de cué.
it is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.
therefore the commission will support these amendments in the council and i hope they can be taken forward.
furthermore i think that it is quite illogical to remove a <UNK> sitting whilst at the same time complaining that the european parliament has an excessive workload.
why would i not say that we have noticed in previous years on the part of the greek government some shortcomings in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society.
is this by any chance the commission s special contribution to the development of the new technologies.
the commission supports amendment no <NUM> in principle and supports the following amendments amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM>.
it is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries particularly in this context.
i am very disappointed that the court of justice of the european communities considered that a discriminatory time limit could be introduced for citizens from third countries.
nonetheless i must also say that the regulation does not allow me on this precise point to issue instructions.
i would also like to congratulate the portuguese presidency because once again it appears that it attended virtually all important debates this week.
lastly we must take account of all sections of the population with the real objective of creating ever more employment especially in the leastfavoured regions.
the next item is the recommendation for second reading <NUM> on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive <NUM> fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> rapporteur mr staes.
in my opinion it is mainly up to a manager to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy.
i am convinced that based on the work carried out we will be in a position with the leadership of the french presidency to conclude the igc before the end of this year as planned.
according to the rules of procedure a vote is to be taken on this.
nonetheless i must ensure that this level of safety also applies to italy germany and all the other countries in the european union.
this concludes the remarks which i would like to make on behalf of the commission at the end of this debate.
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions.
the debate is closed.
i am grateful to commissioner lamy for his answer as far as it went.
in this sense i should like to offer the rapporteur mr savary my full and unequivocal support and congratulate him on his excellent report.
thank you very much mr nielson.
i am glad too that the opinion of the committee on women s rights has been incorporated into the report.
this is a decision of national and local government and this is where all future decisions should be retained.
it would be helpful if i say a few brief words about the grounds for our recommendations.
for all these reasons we reject the buitenweg report.
nevertheless i do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the <NUM> convention which was moreover based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.
we continue to fight against the <UNK> of the extreme right.
the finnish delegation of the ppede group voted in favour of mr van velzen s report and supports him with regard to its content although it contains one point that we cannot accept and that concerns the distribution of the umts spectrum via auction which should not be regulated at community level as he proposes.
i believe that this is important.
it is important for this clearing work to be started before the summer.
the commission has therefore opened daphne to the candidate countries and will do the same under the stop programme.
but it is certainly not right to give them the same aid as all other forms of energy because they make a totally different contribution to the energy mix and it is not right to link aid for one to the lifetime of the others.
firstly there was some discussion about the sort of institutional arrangements that we need to make not least in the commission to cope with the responsibilities of adequately implementing a common foreign and security policy and in particular to ensure that we can play our own role in the nonmilitary aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management.
this is the level at which improvement programmes need to be drawn up in the areas of education housing and employment.
the group for a europe of democracies and diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the andersson report.
finally i hope that in our committee we will be able to stop fighting each other and get on with fighting fraud.
that is why i stated to parliament the commission s intention of presenting to the council and parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy precisely to give us the broader picture within which these partial and sectoral issues can be fully and properly integrated.
members of the house will have noticed that the high representative and i produced a report for the lisbon council and i suspect that mr lagendijk might have noticed that it bore a striking similarity to his own report.
madam president we are debating an extremely serious issue.
we are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the basque country.
pt mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all the commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the <NUM> convention on insolvency proceedings.
i am prepared to accept that some of these are harmless.
i am therefore completely satisfied with the vote as it was held yesterday.
in that respect there is a will to seek an establishment of tariffs which will lead to an increase in exchanges and clear access to the network.
this is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile europe with the people and ensure that the people choose europe rather than jörg haider.
however it is not only the centre s responsibility but also that of the respective member states to ensure that the information sent in is also relevant and can be used for some purpose.
there must be clear definitions of powers in regard to what is to be decided centrally what is to be decided in the member states and what can be decided at regional level.
decisions must be taken at the right level.
my fourth question to the commission is as follows there is a directive on data protection.
let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.
pt mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would first like to congratulate our rapporteur mrs jeggle on her work and say that in fact this price package is no longer as important as it has been in the past since fortunately it has started to turn into the presentation and definition of agricultural policy in the medium term.
it is completely unacceptable that the body that is to be inspected should make its own decision as to what information the inspector is to have.
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the <UNK> <UNK> legislative council to parliament.
it should however realise that this does not create a precedent for the <NUM> discharge.
there are a few points at stake tomorrow.
we will be glad to support you on this.
amendment no <NUM> concerns article <NUM>.
we must also remember that there is another kind of exclusion other than geographical.
i would like to thank the presidentinoffice of the council mr seixas da costa very much for his reply which gives us hope since it demonstrates that the council understands the problem is responding politically and perhaps even <UNK> with the idea.
since <NUM> promoting women in the decisionmaking process has been one of the priority areas of the european union action programme for equal opportunities and is included among the commitments reiterated both by the union institutions and by the member states when they discuss equality between men and women.
the portuguese presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities as furthermore did the president of the european parliament when she stated this at the helsinki european council.
secondly i believe that we should look at this matter in depth and that if as the resolution indicates we could achieve greater cooperation between the various member states during an event such as euro <NUM> progress would be made.
madam president there were two issues within my area of competence dealt with in the commission this morning and i have the pleasure and the honour to report to parliament on both of these issues.
mr president here again i would simply like to draw attention to the fact that in this crop that i know so well the return on investment is long term.
and this is the aim of the commonsense meda programme.
i am sure that none of us here will object to fraud and tax evasion being tackled but i must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the union and i think that many member state governments will be wishing to look very carefully at any extension of qmv before agreeing to it.
firstly i should like to mention some of my most important arguments.
that is the advice i have been given.
like the member states of the european union it wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the un secretarygeneral and his personal envoy mr james baker to find a just equitable and lasting solution for the western sahara.
my group does not merely intend that we should acquire in this way a funding channel for the european parties but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the european parties can function.
mr mulder i should like to start by thanking you on behalf of the commission for your report on granting discharge in respect of the decisions on clearance of accounts of the guarantee section of the eaggf for the <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> financial years.
returning to today s topic i would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs stauner on her report.
and we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in parliament.
i have listened carefully to this interesting debate and i will transmit all the questions which were raised here to my colleague mr barnier and he will respond accordingly.
what is important is that this directive should be swiftly implemented and i believe we have worked hard towards that aim and that we are unlikely to encounter any problems in achieving it.
it is a report which tries to give direction.
but this is not a question of health or environmental protection.
the outcome of the cologne council was the establishment of the stability pact for southeastern europe on <NUM> june <NUM> a pact involving not only the member states of the european union and of course the countries of the region but also the united states and russia.

there is an imperative need for a new policy based on codevelopment conflict prevention and the rejection of the dictates of the financial markets.
they will bolster the role of the european council in the decisionmaking process.
nevertheless to effectively combat child pornography it is necessary in my opinion for europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly as stated in amendment no <NUM> from gerhard schmid.
it was not by chance that the party with the second largest vote in the austrian elections was not invited to form the government.

mr president i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.
the implementation of an economic partnership is especially vital for agriculture.
we are very grateful to the commission for preparing its communication which we impatiently await and which will allow us to pool our energies and unite in a determination to act.
in addition there is a significant connection between the economic activities within israel and those on palestinian territory.
there should therefore be a universal application it is not enough that the <NUM> countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.
as for the council i should like to say that there is great interest in ensuring that situations of this kind can be permanently followed and monitored in close coordination with the commission.
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue.
mr president i would thank the rapporteur for a report that the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party can fully support.
the debate is closed.
the president cut the speaker off.
for that reason we shall vote against both these proposals.
it is therefore.
we are however convinced that this aid will benefit the population only to a very limited extent as there are no plans to control the allocation of these sums and consequently there is nothing to guarantee that they are not at least partly misappropriated by the government or even directly by the wealthy classes.
mr president the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that existed at the end of the <NUM> but since then things have changed greatly.
so i am convinced that other initiatives especially aid to youth associations should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the european union.
there are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification.
madam president mr president of the commission i greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the european union must change fundamentally.
we will examine questions to the council.
in this regard i should like to mention the banking supervision committee which is promoting cooperation between the ecb the national central banks and the supervisory authorities of the <NUM> member states.
we need to examine these <UNK> closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line.
although i think that the commission s proposal is not unreasonable we have to bear in mind that the size limit is being set for the first time and that this species is an important part of the catches of certain fleets in southern spain and portugal where until now they have been fishing for <UNK> without any size restrictions.
amendment no <NUM> deals with the possibility of freeing the distributor by means of the return of contributions once the contract has finished.
it is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the commissions proposals on the whole of article <NUM>.

you have already indicated that owing to the problematic nature of the issue two commissioners are going to give their opinion on it today.
so how are we to deal with this situation.
i look forward to seeing the results.
finally let me repeat we shall have a very great effort to make in order to <UNK> the topics of these negotiations.
finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.
it is now a powerful body.
the rapporteur <UNK> the fall in the exchange rate to a lack of dynamism within the european economy and he is probably right.
we will also make the utmost effort with members of the council particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this house.
this is not only meant as a pleasant <UNK> because what i want to establish above all is that the frenchgerman axis should not only generate <UNK> for the future but should also solve the institutional problems of today and tomorrow.

on behalf of my group i once again condemn these terrorist acts.
the directive on the incineration of waste contains important starting points for introducing compulsory high environmental standards throughout the european union which have already been in place in some member states for a number of years.
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point i would like to extol the political conduct of the portuguese presidency which has repeatedly made a commitment to the european parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.
however i would like to point out one fault in the document.
i think that this is a good system but first i would like to look into the matter with the other vicepresidents who as i do preside over the votes.
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members.
i do not wish to go any deeper into this but he ought to have mentioned it.
so will the commission undertake to make that information available to all members of the european parliament.
we have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can <UNK> with our citizens.
furthermore the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one.
there has to be more transparency however.
mr president of course i voted for the motion.
if the european union wants to enlarge and become an authoritative reference system for the international community we do indeed need a strong coherent reaction from the european institutions but there is also the need for each of us to transcend his own national political interests and focus on the good of the union as a whole by voting responsibly in both political and more importantly humane terms on these issues.
i would also encourage the european council to get to grips with ecofin so that we do not have a situation where the european council approves a resolution and then ecofin does not finance it.
in conclusion let us remember that a state is not defined in terms of the sovereignty it enjoys as a result of its autonomy of action.

we also agreed to speed up the procedures for supplying aid to the balkans.
parliament is considering a proposal for a council regulation on a basis for financing the un operation in kosovo unmik and the costs of the high representative for bosniaherzegovina.
the agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the <UNK> procedure.
this is the dual objective which i believe should be pursued.
only after that and when there have been significant improvements in the area of human rights do we think that we can enter into a new trade agreement with mexico.
i believe that is the background to the reform we are calling for now so as to enable the european union to handle the enlargement process.
i know of your own personal commitment but actually you have not given me any clear indication of what the commission is actually going to do in the un conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time.

we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these.

this was particularly true with some of the american delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.
we are also agreed that the polluterpays principle must apply.
clearly the new commission cannot be held directly responsible for the cases i have referred to even if not all the members of the commission are new.

what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union s policies to date.

i take note of what the report says on the horrific practice of genital mutilation and the lack of data on the subject.
my second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker.
do you believe that these proposals or proposals of this type form part of the mandate of the igc as defined in helsinki.
mr prodi there is one positive thing that i would like to say to you perhaps contrary to the opinion of some members regarding the telegram that you sent to the austrian government.

the resolutions on the european security and defence policy and the new rules governing collaboration between the union and <UNK> are highly positive even if certain aspects of future developments are still somewhat obscure.

we are delighted with the pledge that eu aid will be used to clean the rivers and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in romania and more generally in central and eastern europe.

mr president it has taken us twentyfive years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise.
i welcome the commitment of the commission.
the rights under the treaty are not conditional in my view.

we cannot go on like this.
i very much hope commissioner that we will disseminate this kind of information in zimbabwe because those people trying to mount an opposition campaign will be <UNK> by the kind of information that we have had from you today and i think that would be important.
we sincerely hope however that developments in the peace process will make it possible to hold a meeting not just at ministerial level but also at head of state and government level in order to set the seal as it were on the emergence of a new era in the middle east.
finally i urge the commission to ensure that there is strict compliance with the fifth research framework programme s call for no support to be provided for any form of human cloning.

<NUM> by mrs muscardini and mr <UNK> on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group on iraq.

i would like to highlight this and ask what sort of timetable is now in place for real action taking into account the fact that we have to put our own house in order before new member states join the eu.
it is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the european parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society or not as the case may be.
the <UNK> of mergers takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the <UNK> of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.

parliament approved the legislative resolution.
at any rate cooperation in terms of criminal prosecution at european level still leaves a great deal to be desired.
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the <UNK> of investigations by olaf without harming the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice.
the question of access to information in order to be able to carry out the discharge procedure with the required degree of seriousness and with the documents which you need for the discharge process was central to various interventions.
i intend to confine myself to this point in what i have to say.
but it is not going to be easy to get an agreement and i would like to see the document in detail before passing judgement on what the commissioner said this afternoon.

i hope that the debate will convince a few more people.
in terms of order of size it may perhaps be a little more but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve.
it has to be said that in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy the european union is bound to go down the same road as many member states have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.
having made these general observations i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg.
on the contrary and in the name of the completion of the internal market and the follow up to the lisbon special summit we have seen new pressures for speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation of the labour market.

various aspects of this debate are being carefully considered such as for example the questions of whether a common supervisory authority for all the instruments of the third pillar should be created or whether it would be sensible to create a common secretariat for these authorities.
that is why today we are asking not to have any nasty <UNK> in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism come monday.
however he was unable to appreciate that the emergence of the middle classes was an element which was going to have a different effect for the first time on these elections.
one of these is the issue of water.
i believe it is entirely proper that mr poettering should demand that this issue be dealt with here this week and i would urge the commission to give the necessary assurance not only because i agree with the sentiments of commissioner patten but because the world at large wishes to be reassured that there is no <UNK> at the heart of europe on the question of enlargement.
madam president given that a political group which did not participate in the negotiations of the text in question has signed the text i would ask you before the vote takes place to give the appropriate instructions to the relevant administration service so that this kind of abuse does not happen again.
mr president the social democrats group and i myself most emphatically welcome this agreement between the european community on the one hand and the swiss confederation on the other.
that strategy is to make the european union the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion.
it is a question of doing what is technically possible obviously it is not possible to do <UNK> but we must be sufficiently ambitious.

i can tell you that the commission is not carrying out an assessment even now.
mrs schörling you spoke of the matter of additionality.

to sum up this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for anticipating industrial change.
in the interests of mediumsized enterprises we want to prevent <UNK> liability risks and avoid excessive compensation for parties which have suffered minor damage at the expense of consumers as a whole since at the end of the day it is they who must pay for such compensation in the form of higher prices.
pt mr president the results of the lisbon summit demonstrate that everything the portuguese presidency has up to now presented as a priority for employment and for combating social exclusion has merely been a massive attempt to pull the <UNK> over our eyes.

the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured.
the council presidency for its part signalled that the comitology measures could be deleted and that it could be left to the commission to take full responsibility for implementation.
as regards the commissions position with respect to the amendments tabled by parliament i wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this house on tuesday <NUM> february.
consequently the commission takes the view that this tricky issue can only be dealt with as part of a wider and overall examination of the common fisheries policy as a whole.
the proposal provides not only for the protection of consumers and workers health.
there are therefore two points to which i would like to draw the commission s attention.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr peijs on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the commission communication to the council the european parliament the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions on the development of short sea shipping in europe a dynamic alternative in a sustainable transport chain second <UNK> progress report.
there were representatives from echo the directorategeneral for development and the member states of the european union.

the proposal for a directive on family reunification as approved by the watson report proclaims a communitylevel law on family reunification which in legal terms does not yet exist at this level and which in our opinion should not be made law.
the debate is closed.
that is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda.
in terms of comitology amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> also apply in part insofar as the rights of parliament are concerned.
negotiations are now under way regarding the future accession of twelve countries to the european union.

your fellow members who are giving their explanations of vote.
in any case the way is clear for future discussion of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive structures.
it is important but it contains several deficiencies and needs to be supplemented.
progress has been made that is for sure as has already been mentioned by previous speakers.
on behalf of the commission i should like to say that the commission shares these concerns.
the people are <UNK>.
this is a political issue.
this is not the way to solve the problem of smoking.
but two of these aims really are vital to the european union.

it is very important that we get movement in that area in the transport council.
finally following on from what was agreed in tampere the report <UNK> the need for a european public prosecutor.
i would now like to turn to the much discussed issue of category.
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner i must begin by highlighting the excellent work that mr di lello finuoli has carried out on this report which received as he has already said the almost unanimous support of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs.
on the other hand however both the rapporteur and the members have stressed that this occasion calls for reflection upon the way in which the centre operates and upon the results it has produced in recent years and i feel that we cannot say we are satisfied with its performance up until now.
madam president that is why i have voted against this motion.
madam president thank you giving me this opportunity to speak on the oral questions tabled by the committee on constitutional affairs.
therefore if the president wishes to take this route a report by the legal affairs committee is absolutely essential and it would be irregular not to proceed in that way.
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam came into force in may and this parliament stated that the most farreaching innovation in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom security and justice.
we shall have to monitor the court of justice very closely.
but i do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate cuba.
i want to make it clear at the outset that the commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at el ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.
i should like to make it absolutely clear that is not the case because our group would certainly not want to be seen to be supporting an amendment by the tdi group.
it has to be recognised that even here there is a deep gulf between rich and poor.
there are many points in the present resolution which the liberal group can endorse.
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present given his powers.
and i have been really surprised at the low level of interest aroused by one of this year s most important reports from the committee on culture youth education the media and sport or rather to tell you the truth i have not been surprised at all.
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men s report should be implemented.
this is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here mr president and i am very pleased to do so.
it is in fact something very positive.
what we need is an annual report on the economic and social situation in the union so as to enable us to develop an eu policy with benchmarking and specific quantitative and qualitative figures and objectives for investment and growth.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
i would remind you of the measures for improving the selectivity of fishing gear which came into force this year.
therefore mr president while i am in absolute agreement with many of the things said in the resolution i disagree with many others and regret for example with regard to an issue as important as the court of justice that the resolution essentially fails to provide for the necessary reform of this institution nor does it provide suitable clear guidelines in this respect.
mr president commissioners i too should again like to confirm that postponement must not be construed as a refusal of discharge.
i also believe that the sanctions against austria ought to be lifted and preferably sooner rather than later.
thirdly we also support the proposal to allow representatives from the candidate countries of central and eastern europe to attend committee meetings from the outset.
mr president it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.
this has clearly been the case in the telecommunication industry.
i can tell you that i have indeed received mr wiebenga s letter and that this matter is on the agenda for tonight s meeting of the bureau.
mr president i must confess that i am extremely unhappy that we are not going to vote on this motion today.
this is a huge challenge for us in parliament and for the translation services in the other institutions.
amendment <NUM> introduces an important reference to the polluterpays principle.
the foreign affairs ministers of the european union participated in that meeting.
there is still a lack of optimism and also confidence in europe which we need if we are to think at all seriously in terms of positive economic development.
mr president mrs matikainenkallström i am sorry that there was no interpretation at the beginning.
there is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.
but for that it seems to me we also need the debate at the feira european council to give us a political signal.
i believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community.
however i regret that i am not in a position to accept written amendment no <NUM> which mr graefe zu baringdorf put forward last week.
i believe it is scheduled for an hour and a half.
i agree with mr martínez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims.
we must take steps to ensure that labelling does not result in a renationalisation of the food sector.
we hope that the commission will administer these guidelines in a flexible way so that on the one hand market competition is guaranteed and on the other we do not create situations of <UNK> or limitation of economic activity with regard to the distributors.
i welcome the fact that under article <NUM> the money for routine projects is to be separated from emergency aid measures.
i must also congratulate the council on its flexibility in the face of the criticisms put forward by parliament and the commission for its effective mediation.
nonetheless personally speaking i have always been rather worried to see the incineration of dangerous and nondangerous waste dealt with in the same legislation and i expressed my opinion on this point at first reading.
in order to reduce these deficiencies it has been proposed to use the information available within the framework of the abovementioned regulation ec no <NUM> in the integrated administration system which mr casaca spoke about earlier in this magnificent report.
mr president each of the countries referred to in this report is different and each of the plans varies accordingly.
and at the level of the european union the question of whether the <NUM> member states need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.
the situation in kosovo today is different.
madam president ladies and gentlemen the declaration of principles for the transitional period and for the talks on permanent status was drawn up on the basis of a defined philosophy and clear political principles particularly un security council resolutions <NUM> and <NUM> and their implementation the territories in exchange for peace and a timetable for the negotiations on the permanent status.
however the other side of the coin is the outcome of the feira summit and in my view the results for all fifteen member states were more than disappointing.
what do they want to know.
this issue was studied at the intergovernmental conference that established the treaty of amsterdam and it was considered at the time and i say this as someone who was there representing the portuguese government that there was not a majority let alone unanimity among the member states in favour of creating a specific legal basis in this area.
i should be most interested to hear the commission s comments on this.
lastly will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation.
thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur mr wieland the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has had no trouble highlighting a few important points in the directive before us today.
in line with these priorities the president and several members of the commission have made it clear on many occasions how much importance they attach to the civil dialogue.
in this respect it is critically important that the funding should be properly applied.
we intend to vote against both proposed amendments.
the <UNK> legislation should have been implemented by <NUM> it is now the year <NUM>.
although the actual implementation of the stability pact has not yet started the commission has already developed the new instrument entitled the stabilisation and association agreement.
therefore we should only concentrate on the requests that were actually made.
mr president i would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.
thirdly the european union must show solidarity with venezuela and with latin america in general so that we can counteract the negative effects of the great influence of the north of the continent on the rest of it.
with regard to the european regulations after the previous unstable regulation which furthermore was different for the different sectors in <NUM> the first banking sector directive was amended to allow member states to reach agreements on the exchange of information with third countries on the condition that the information exchanged was subject to guarantees of professional secrecy at least equivalent to those in force in the european union.
as far as the debate on the ludford and haarder reports is concerned allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my group.
it should be noted that interest on its own capital is the european central bank s only reliable source of income.
therefore madam president mr president of the commission i would ask that this issue which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the european union be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.
ladies and gentlemen first of all i must inform you that it has not yet been possible to make available all of the language versions of the minutes.
this is wrong for several reasons.
we consider that mr sterckx s report falls short of being able to solve the actual problems but it is a first step in the right direction.
we can take action against this it is possible.
on third pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom security and justice it is unacceptable for the presidencyinoffice of the council to be absent.
the vote will be taken tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
however there is of course also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the european parliament.
the proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation the protection of public health.
we do not dispute the fact that smoking damages your health and we therefore agree with the spirit of the directive proposed by the european commission.
however as a member of the committee on development and cooperation i must express my reservations at the lack of support from the european parliament.
accordingly the commission has now presented a proposal for revision of the financial perspective and for a multiannual programme for the western balkans.
madam president ladies and gentlemen i was among those who were present throughout friday.
these virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the eu at the moment of enlargement.
it is of course and i should like to stress this point prepared to help with the full implementation of the agreements that have been concluded when the time comes.
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission.
i would also very much like to thank mrs gröner for taking on this mammoth task and still being able in the end to reach a satisfactory outcome with the council and the commission.
in the area of police cooperation the commission wishes to remind honourable members that in <NUM> europol was given a mandate by the council to combat trafficking in human beings with the basic aim of ensuring that all networks of traffickers working in europe would be closed down.
could you please make sure that <UNK> members of this house know that the word <UNK> is not correct.
if i can use this opportunity i would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future for example we do not manage to vote on a tuesday evening we could squeeze in an extra round of voting so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week.
report <NUM> by ms smet and ms gröner on behalf of the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities on the followup to the beijing action platform <NUM>.
i believe we have struck a balance between europe of the states and europe of the citizens.
my colleague mrs morgan spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure.
coordination within the commission and complementarity with the member states and other donors are factors which are fundamental to the efficiency which reform is intended to produce.
in my opinion you do not get something for nothing.
the existing rules under which a maximum of <NUM> of the total investment can be funded by the union are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the european economy as a whole.
we feel that everything that can be possibly be done now and in the future including in terms of equal opportunities must be done and followed up the palestinian people has the right to selfdetermination without prejudice to the rights of the state of israel.
this approach is quite evident in the proposal for the media <UNK> training programme from the very first paragraph of the introduction and from article <NUM> of the proposal for a decision which aims to allow professionals in the industry to take full advantage of the european and international dimension of the market.
it is only right that the meeting in lisbon at the end of the month should stop to consider where we are exactly.
nevertheless i repeat that the commission has stated that there is absolutely no danger of direct aid to farmers being reduced and that this is simply a question of taking advantage of savings essentially <UNK> from changes in the eurodollar exchange rate.
that is why european unification policy is in essence a policy of peace.
that is naturally not enough.
there is no problem between parliament and the commission.
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.
i therefore call upon all members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the community to make representations to their national governments to this effect.
if the european citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being if the mandate that our president mrs fontaine has <UNK> on a closer relationship between the union and europe s citizens is to be effective our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.
madam president i would ask you and the group chairmen that in future we always ensure that whenever we have discussions with the high representative the commission takes the floor as a matter of form because the commission must play its part in the development of european policy.
mr president since the issue of regulation <NUM> in <NUM> we have been discussing rebuilding a relationship between the consumer and the production world and i have to say that a great deal has been achieved on both sides.
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed.
i am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the european parliament after its excellent political debate yesterday should not adopt a stance on this matter.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr lagendijk on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the stabilisation and association process for countries of southeastern europe <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
however the commission believes that the process of drafting the charter must yield a clear and concise text perfectly accessible to the european public but which is also drafted in rigorous legal terms that can be accepted as legally binding.
we are leaving it for the future.
what does the commission intend to do regarding this issue.
i ask the commission to answer these questions today and to get its internal <UNK> under control.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is also important to create a community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known.
the european summit in lisbon was right to emphasise again the importance of having integrated and efficient financial markets and this house will also be in favour of keeping to a strict timetable.
europe must become more competitive.
we expect the commission to implement it.
i am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and i would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with south africa.
i believe that this is exactly what has happened a veil of silence has been drawn over events in angola a country which has been in a state of permanent war for <NUM> years and at civil war for <NUM> years.
firstly i think that community law must be seen as a whole.
it may be premature for the european parliament to <UNK> its position on certain points the precise content of which will emerge from the debate which is now beginning but in some cases it may be appropriate to establish this content.
following the vote on the commission proposal.
fifthly the importance and role of small and mediumsized businesses.
el once more the hypocrisy of the european union is evident both in the state of and respect for human rights within the union and in its international policy on these matters.
surely it should be our common goal once the <UNK> state of palestine is in place for there to be an agreement between the state of palestine and the eu which is identical in content to that between israel and the eu.
it is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to <UNK> ethnic tensions can only be successful by using mechanisms which involve the protection and separation of the waters.
<NUM> by mr papayannakis and mr sjöstedt on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left.
this is an aspect that the european central bank and the commission should bear in mind.
therefore on a final note i urge you to reject the committee s proposal the directive in its present form and i stress in its present form not in any form on account of its lacking a legal basis and <UNK> the principle of subsidiarity.
we should also remember that over <NUM> of the bananas consumed in the union come from <UNK> third countries.
it is our view that the igc must succeed that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds but not at any price.
in the light of the fact that over a <UNK> period the entire population of the african elephant has <UNK> from <NUM> million to <NUM> <NUM> we have now reached a critical level as is widely known.
that is why i cannot agree to amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM>.
i would like to use this opportunity to thank all the community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation.
i would like to tell you that in fact it is not just an environmental problem it is a very important environmental problem but it is also a very important social problem.
the time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment.
there is a problem however which we need to address together.
the level of practical assistance from the community and from the member states has been pathetic.
fourthly and finally i would like to point out that what we need to do now is to analyse very carefully on the basis of this report what conclusions we should draw if we are to secure a <UNK> right to information for all citizens in the future.
the commission will be called upon in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year <NUM> to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.
in this connection i should like to emphasise that the conditions for monitoring such measures have been improved by the fact that the authorities on mauritius now have to submit a detailed report each year and by the fact that the commission is able to review payments in the light of whether the various measures have in practice been carried out.
it may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.
it is also established in paragraph o that the purpose is not to create a single diplomatic service for the eu to replace the foreign services of the member states.
this will only be feasible if every last member state of the european union joins monetary union.
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and in the end to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.
i am sure that the council will adhere to that rule as it is in their interests our interests and both of our interests to agree on both the procedure to adopt as well as the substance of the budget.
they are parties of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate directly in their activities.
finally i would draw your attention to a printing error.
and i would like to tell my friend mr cohnbendit that at this very moment.
it seems to me that <UNK> that with a loss of eur <NUM> million is a gross exaggeration.
the second important point for me is no longer the issue of costs and competition.
madam president i am sorry to take the floor to raise an issue which is not a point of order but i feel that i should explain what happened today to some interpreters officials and meps.
this underlines the seriousness of the problems.
that is why this point is incorporated.
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.
the second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of immigration in the regulation.
and the merit of mr corrie s report is that it highlights the value of this original proactive development instrument together with the work carried out by the joint assembly.
mr president confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level the member states must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.
there is a lack of agreement.
mr president commissioner at a time when we are trying to correct regional disparities mrs peijs s report is very opportune since it deals with the matter of short sea shipping and asks member states and the commission to adopt measures to promote this type of transport.
in doing so it would nevertheless allow the institutions to engage in a more thorough dialogue in this area and hopefully allow us to find a more permanent solution by <NUM>.
at the same time this change of system will also lead to more <UNK> being placed on the individual in the business world of course.
some people may not like the fact that the technical group has been set up but it has been.
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.
mr president commissioner andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the european union.
amendment no <NUM> makes reference to this.
we will examine questions to the commission.
my question to the commissioner is this what is to be done.
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.
the president declared the common position approved as amended.
furthermore i would like you to look at mrs stauner s report from the most positive point of view possible.
the vote will take place at <NUM> am.
but it is not only visàvis our own member states that we have a role to play we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries those which we as meps have brought together in new york.
i shall give the floor to mr watson who is the chairman of this committee.
we need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine <UNK> concept.
clearly we are not looking at matters from the same perspective.
decisions relating to security and defence policy are immensely important and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy.
he said that at present there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> on behalf of the union for europe of the nations group to the commission on political parties at european level.
a total of <NUM> amendments have been tabled.
resumption of the session.
i can therefore understand denmark s initiative which now seeks to deal with this issue afresh within the framework of the community powers.
in such cases we seek to use the instruments available to us to exert pressure in a timely and effective way.
as liberals we can support this concept when it means that we in the eu are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.
secondly it should be borne in mind that the regional approach is appropriate and important and that it is important for the european union to play a guiding role throughout this matter.
another area which i would like to mention as an example of the detailed nature of our plan is an issue which is very closely related to the environment fisheries and the exploitation of natural resources.
the commission has not yet taken a decision but serious consideration is being given to such a procedure.
this does not bode well at all for the future.
in the light of the progress of scientific research in this field it seemed vital to clarify the scope of this legislation in order to give due protection to consumer health as also to the environment.
my second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive.
they have successfully stated the importance of this matter for the european parliament europe and its citizens.
meanwhile we should reaffirm the european union s full commitment to the peace process and our willingness to honour our historic economic and also political responsibilities in the region.
we have seen this in the case of mozambique and other disasters.
that is not unreasonable.
parliament gave its assent.
the commission s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines but it is important to point out that so far no vaccine has actually been found.
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level using all the means at our disposal technological structural and socioeconomic to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.
amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> concern organisations falling within the scope of aid.
thank you for your reply.
i shall not confine myself to congratulating you i should also like to say that the composition of the french national team is decidedly a pioneering way of seeing the multiracial and multicultural europe of tomorrow.
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.
we are hoping for synergy in the coordination of the interregional and transnational cooperation programmes and for coordination between the interreg and meda programmes.
like mrs hautala i am therefore very happy that the committee on petitions has survived the attempts to remove it since as well as demanding compliance with community law it is the committee which is closest to the citizens.
i call on the uk and scottish governments to play a full part in that campaign.
mr president as you have said we will be voting on the compromise motions agreed in an informal conciliation procedure with the commission.
we will have to establish whether there is a quorum.
we want to make certain in europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction.
the next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading <NUM> by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> rapporteur mrs palacio vallelersundi.
the commission is in the process of drafting a proposal a general framework intended to facilitate the payment of contributions by occupational pension institutions which are located in other member states.
i would like to ask the commission and i am glad that commissioner solbes is here with us this evening to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme with the corresponding report requested by parliament so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up as we have been promised.
a report is also to be prepared which will be submitted to the feira european council.
there is nothing more european than this and i therefore welcome mr schmitt s report.
i think that you could allow me that much time.
mr president i have of course voted for mr langen s excellent report and i congratulate him on his work and also on his report.
as a new member of the european parliament it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.
on the contrary they have multiplied.
i and my colleague <UNK> <UNK> who is well <UNK> in this matter have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of smes and craft <UNK> within the framework of interreg the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and i welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.
we must allow the market that is to say <UNK> and <UNK> to choose for themselves.
it is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings.
mr president on a point of order.
with regard to the first section we must admit that although the directives in question have been transposed in some cases <UNK> into national legislation many obstacles remain which must be overcome by adopting a raft of <UNK> measures.
i believe that mrs schierhuber s proposal is a balanced one.
what we in fact face is a turning point for the people of the region for the first time there is a real possibility of an end to half a century of conflict between israel and palestine but there is also a risk if this hope is <UNK> of a resurgence of violence.
mr president i have asked to take the floor simply because the italian translation of paragraph <NUM> is very strange.
i think that this is also about the credibility of the union and in particular parliament.
what do we do then on our own.
this too has not been solved.
however the commission cannot accept that the exemption is only temporary.
the kla s criminal activity must be brought to an end.
this shows that we were working at top speed in excellent cooperation with the commission and i must here emphasise the role of commissioner verheugen in order to move forward as quickly as possible with the work on enlargement.
i should like to ask first if a minister or commissioner questioned here is able not only to refuse to reply but to do so in a completely disdainful manner and if we are supposed to take i have already replied as an answer when they have not done so.
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.
in the last partsession here in strasbourg we discussed what needs to be done about the internet.
we also believe that we need a common strategy in the mediterranean as the resolution states and that together with political social and security aspects special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension.
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.
we have what we require in order to deal with endoflife cars.
i believe this is a <UNK> which has still to be resolved.
i do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at european council level is a particularly welcome development.
report <NUM> by mr valdivielso de cué on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ec no <NUM> on financial and technical measures to accompany meda the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the euromediterranean partnership <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president ladies and gentlemen mr mombaur s report on the state of liberalisation of the energy electricity and gas markets has the merit of <UNK> the various commission communications on the issue.
we must also remember that applicant countries ie the countries of central and eastern europe should be involved in this fraud prevention process for the very reason that such a large share of the community budget is administered within the member states.
madam president i voted for the measure contained within the savary report on the transeuropean conventional rail system.
mr president the debate on my report on the european union s action plans on asylumseekers and migrants has been postponed until this evening at <NUM> pm and the vote until tomorrow at <NUM> am.
this is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached and it should immediately be said that if any amendments such as amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM> or the revised amendments nos <NUM> or <NUM> were to be passed the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped and we would vote against it.
it is a disgrace and i hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation.
we wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied and applied as quickly as possible.
we are simply proposing a more effective use of the competencies which have already been granted.
the council s amendments which extend the scope of money cannot be in the interest of the consumer.
we do not want the us model a model which has <UNK> failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.
part of the purpose of this document is to try to generate more ideas from members of this parliament who of course are so familiar with the important activity which we are addressing.
very well i shall do so.
the first is this it must be made clear who is negotiating on the us side.
the fact that no provision has been made for serbia in the draft budget or only to a very limited extent sends out the wrong message in my view.
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative <UNK> which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.
this house should do its utmost to ensure that public health and safety is high on the agenda.
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.
nor can the commission subscribe to amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> which relate to the comitology and provide for the use of the consultation procedure in the case of both regulations.
the issue of equality between men and women in europe in terms of statutory standardisation is suffering under the rule of the restrictive <UNK>.
however the committee on the environment has tabled numerous amendments most of which i support.
it is a great disappointment for me that there is such great hatred that it is not possible for serbs roma and other minorities to live in peace in kosovo although they are under an international protectorate.
mr president the rapporteur clearly explained the meaning of the text in the sense referred to by mr imbeni.
certainly if i look at paragraph five of the directive where it says that certain processes are not to be considered patentable then it seems to me that the directive is perfectly clear.
i call on all colleagues to do likewise.
i particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging especially as regards trade and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.
only the commission would have the authority to act in this respect.
in the meeting of <NUM> march the council invited the commission to work on a proposal and to present this to the council with a view to including montenegro in the agency s mandate.
i notice that more than <NUM> members have made this request.
i am prepared to make this analysis because i have done so before.
altener will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the member states.
i would particularly like to thank those who were themselves working on this issue at the time for their cooperation and to reaffirm the commission s promise to report every six months on the implementation of the action plan.
to this of the events of the last six months we can add the entry of greece into the euro and the decision taken at the feira european council on the tax package.
in feira we did not see a decision to incorporate the charter of fundamental rights into the treaty one of the decisions most eagerly anticipated by the people of europe.
thank you mrs gröner.
there are too many jobs at stake.
we often talk of a new economy but if then at the end of the day we ourselves do not focus on the potential core factors which in this case are culture and new technology then we will certainly not be able to produce solutions.
you are all aware of how heated the debate in the committee on agriculture and rural development and the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy was.
two major factors can be identified with regard to the liberalisation process of the energy market.
we fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at european level as an integral part of the equal programme.
i am delighted to report that the european parliament and the commission have worked together closely and constructively on this issue.
in a nutshell the eu s future member states are making a direct appeal for solidarity to the current eu members.
it all went to the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries in spite of the fact that i was very careful to announce to parliament that this would have to be what we call a <UNK> operation because of the situation there.
with regard to the concrete proposals contained in the eeurope <UNK> i can only wonder why the council has not discussed them before so as to ensure commitment on the part of member states.
our demands must not be more conservative than those of the european commission or of individual member states.
i can well understand why commissioner verheugen is somewhat <UNK> by the fact that candidate countries are being <UNK> in the name of the council and the various member states and being promised that they can definitely join our club one year or the other.
that is the spirit in which the union proposes to help turkey find a solution to the kurdish problem.
it is the first time that the european union has agreed to discuss the problem of their indebtedness with all the african countries in an institutional framework outside the international financial organisations.
the general orientation of these decisions is to keep citizens of the member states of the european union from the centres of decisionmaking and to prevent them from interfering with developments.
we all have to move faster if we are to make a greater success of the programme.
only in this way can we do what we are supposed to do and restore the public confidence that mrs schreyer spoke about this morning.
as i understand during the hearing in august the commission will present at the end of this <UNK> a package of proposals on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children.
however i would particularly like to explain why i supported the proposals for amendments tabled by mr virrankoski and mr mulder.
it should be noted that these conventions are binding on the european union and the member states which have ratified them.
parliament rejected the request from the group of the party of european socialists.
we therefore call on the commission to.
but at the end of the day it is the people living near airports who suffer.
i also see this report as an action plan for the eu delegation that is to take up an excellent negotiating position in new york in june and that is to strengthen women s rights in close cooperation with the representatives of governmental and nongovernmental organisations.
when i look at the petitions which have been sent to the european parliament s committee on petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle i am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward.
what is interesting <UNK> this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.
i speak as the coordinator of the eldr group on the legal affairs committee.
i think that this is an extremely important point this sense of conditionality which underlies the european union s position is being maintained by the council and will continue to be maintained.
it is also important that the trend should be towards a technologically more neutral operational environment and that the <UNK> approach be abandoned as far as possible.
the delta of the danube is in danger.
i will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but i am certain that on examination mrs theato will be able to see that in the details of the white paper there are very strong assurances.
i have corresponded with the president of our parliament on this issue and she has written to me assuring me that this matter would be corrected and that the british flag would be <UNK> the right way up.
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union.
mr president the three previous speakers have already articulated the significance of these proposals.
before i set the signal for the <UNK> to green and because we have another new team here i should like to make a brief comment.
the european union is committed to promoting peace and stability not only in europe but throughout the world.
madam president i agree with mrs <UNK> that the merit of the durban conference was to make it clear that aids is not being fought in the same way in europe and in africa.
there is therefore a need for an indepth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.
consequently i have tabled some amendments to mr koch s intrinsically excellent report which have been adopted by our committee.
we will look into this matter.
in the text of the resolution reference was made to this state.
as on other occasions such as the intergovernmental conference of <NUM> this parliament must offer the commission its support in order to monitor information activities.
i would like to advocate this.
we have to stress the importance of the fact that food safety and the european agricultural model should be a basic issue with us and one that serves as a vision of the future but in the member states we are ignoring issues of a basic nature which would help monitor systems that would ensure this.
we have an opportunity of doing something about that this week.
i would be interested to hear about his trip and what he thinks of the criticism of the government.
but the least we could have expected was for parliament now to decide to take serious steps to protect the consumer.
mr president first and foremost i must apologise on behalf of my colleague mrs echerer who felt <UNK> and has gone to see the doctor.
you have mr solana heard the force of the criticisms made by the members of parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in kosovo chechnya and elsewhere.
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.
this particularly applies to the right of eu citizens themselves to live together in their home land with family members originating from a third country and not to be in the position where the only way they can live with them as a family is to avail themselves of freedom of movement and settle in another member states.
we have to get this right.
in its capacity as the current holder of the presidency of the union portugal welcomes this programme and wishes it success so that we can build a europe of equal opportunities for all.
the economic value of the postal service was recognised by the treaty of amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.
mr dell alba with regard to the first part of your intervention we are indeed in the throes of internal reform of this house.
the <UNK> european council made a commitment of this kind and it should not be forgotten.
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs and at a more general level with parliament.
so when we are negotiating peace in the middle east we feel every day that we are not just doing what is good for our people but we try harder and double our efforts because we have a sense of responsibility to the extent that the stability of our region is the key to the stability of the rest of the world.
in order to strengthen the funding of social security systems we need a policy of general wage increase the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each member state.
in terms of staff policy an analysis should therefore be carried out as requested in the report of the current <UNK> of the institution s staff in the light of parliament s clearly changing needs in order to make the best possible preparations for the necessary structural adaptations.
that has been very good and very effective through the year.
we are very sad to hear of the death of mrs <UNK> <UNK> on <NUM> may <NUM> in rome.
this legislation is unnecessary at a european level.
we discussed yesterday mr <UNK> excellent report on our external services and the importance of enhancing the effectiveness of what the european union does around the world.
in terms of the igc issue i have a specific question for you.
more than this for many of us in israel europe is not just a continent.
mr president there are three countries outside emu.
i have the pleasure of <UNK> mr maccormick in the legal affairs committee.
it is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and we believe that on the basis of work already done it will be possible at least in the field of seizure of assets for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.
commissioner i believe that we all agree on the importance of sport its specific characteristics its social function and the many areas in which we use it in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
before the vote at the plenary sitting new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee.
i also welcome amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> to annex iv.
there has been a plethora of declarations of intent and announcements to do with reform none of which have a great deal of substance to them.
we too have to prepare by reforming the institutions and there is a long way to go.
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union s common foreign and security policy.
it seems that european industry is more important here than our own principles our own <UNK> and the interests of the developing countries.
finally i would like to reiterate the view which i have held for some years that an obligation must also be placed on providers and by way of conclusion may i again stress that it would perhaps be useful to formulate a uniform definition of children within the union.
it is a sensitive subject.
during the finnish presidency substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information technology and in particular the internet.
mr president the resolution submitted for parliament s consideration on air transport contains serious dangers which i should like to highlight.
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.
my group as mr kindermann has already said will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and i hope that other groups in this house will do likewise.
it is therefore extremely important.
in conclusion i would add that it is important to include the topic of closer cooperation on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the portuguese presidency in this area but in our opinion the agenda cannot be extended to include this subject alone without serious consideration of all the other points put forward by parliament in the resolution of <NUM> april.
i would like to remind you however that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared the fifth programme for equality between men and women.
there are other areas that we must look at.
mr president i would agree with the general approach taken by the honourable member but i would like to remind him of the margin for manoeuvre of these policies at a european level especially since they are national policies.
therefore when voting time is resumed this afternoon a rapporteur or another member of the committee will be able to request that the report be put to the vote in september.
if the union takes the initiative this will have a <UNK> effect because this debate is occurring all over the world including in the usa and japan.
this is the correct procedure and i think that although i was not present in the committee on legal affairs the proposal does not reflect it.
i would like to express my deepest thanks and appreciation.
in the eu this is a crucial issue in the mediterranean region and also in other european countries where we are witnessing the gradual <UNK> of <UNK> areas.
we share these expectations but we should also like to be able to congratulate the practical results achieved.
i want to thank the council for its answer.
those are the main points i would like to make.
first of all i wanted to vote against amendment no <NUM>.
we are therefore pleased with mrs damião s excellent report which highlights the urgent need to revise the <NUM> directive.
mr president i would like to congratulate mrs <UNK> on the excellent work of the committee on culture youth education and the media and i would also like to stress the extremely high level of agreement and synergy between the committees to the extent and this is proof that the main body of the report and those expressing the opinions of the different committees were all approved unanimously.
this is what rule <NUM> states.
we have room for conciliation and the advantage if we adopt these amendments tomorrow is that parliament would be openly engaged in the final form of this proposal which otherwise we will not be.
we hope to reach our first conclusions at next december s council so that we can contribute to the preparation of the commission s draft directive which is planned for the beginning of <NUM>.
i note that parliaments committee on legal affairs and the internal market also accepts that article <NUM> is the appropriate legal base.
it is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long.
is the chairman of this committee in a position to provide information to the house on the commission s views on such a critical situation.
this is not our opinion.
this is because today there are still genuine obstacles to the <UNK> of the internal market genuine obstacles to the four freedoms laid down in the treaty precisely because we do not have a clear legal basis.
will the commission propose that financial resources be released for implementation of the eeurope initiative.
the president cut the speaker off.
mr president there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in football at a european level and globally.
we are all agreed on the polluter pays principle.
they are fully aware of the whole union s opposition to the death penalty and all executions.
parliament adopted the resolution.
russia and the united states are important in this connection.
the first is the mention of austria and the entry of haider s party into government and <UNK> the parliament s decision in february.
an example is the directive on the information and consultation of workers which you mentioned that has been awaiting a solution for years and upon which the european parliament gave its opinion very clearly in april last year.
that is the clear aim of the amendments in the name of mr hernandez mollar and his colleagues and this is consistent throughout all the amendments on behalf of the epp the socalled european peoples party which actually reveals itself in its amendments as a party for some of the people but not all of them.
in my opinion we should be able to have a <NUM> error rate within a number of years.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
the commission is therefore delighted at mrs sörensen s excellent report on which i congratulate her.
the fact of the matter is that although there is an awareness of the enormous impact of money laundering and other forms of corruption it is necessary to safeguard our citizens right to legal advice and assistance.
thank you very much commissioner patten.
so our treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late but we are not at that point today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.
to the members of the committee on industry external trade research and energy i want to say that the un resolution in accordance with the gothenburg protocol is far from being adequate.
mrs ludford s report bears witness to this.
so we could not afford to miss this opportunity and the lisbon european council did exactly what was required to provide europe with a certain degree of coherence in terms of a general strategy for modernising the economy and employment.
as i said mrs kratsatsagaropoulou we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights.
if you feel dutybound to reject it you will have an opportunity to do so.
we do not want to wait for five years let others follow our example.
we want to reinforce europe s role on the international stage in a clear and unequivocal manner just as we want to increase its competitiveness.
he does not need a government to do so or a parliament nor does he need a commission to do so.
i know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but without a doubt in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success.
at that time my group and the greens voted in committee to resolve that problem.
it is up to us to seize this opportunity.
<NUM> by mrs malmström on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party on freedom of expression in angola.
the community s global contribution to the hipc trust fund in its capacity as a donor will amount to eur <NUM> million for <UNK> acp countries.
mr president i ask you to rule it admissible for this debate to now take place as was the wish of the house earlier in the week.
these aspects are very much <UNK>.
the text appears to be saying that violations of fundamental rights are permitted if the european parliament is in agreement which seems rather absurd to me.
the legislative instrument that we are considering today in the evaluation report referred to us by the commission has run its course as far as contractual rights and social security systems are concerned.
with regard to more practical aspects let me restate my determination to try to find some way together with the european parliament to have parliament play an active part in these negotiations.
i believe this is the next logical step.
the commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.
we are not going to oppose the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change.
it is an important instrument for future environmental policy.
in the light of this i would like to make the following observations.
i will not do so.
this is a danger and risk to which we are alert.
loud applause it is in that spirit that i now welcome you on behalf of the european parliament.
this is why parliament on behalf of the citizen has to send out a signal to the union s large member states.
let us not try to insist that all our ideas should be automatically accepted and included in the negotiations just because they are ours.
in my own country italy there are some <NUM> <NUM> postal workers who cost the state approximately itl <NUM> million a year per capita or eur <NUM> <NUM> that is a total cost of around eur <NUM> million.
we have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important.
i abstained on amendment no <NUM>.
finally i would like to ask you as i do not have any hard facts at my disposal regarding the acceding countries whether it would be possible to analyse the status quo in the candidate countries ideally as soon as possible so that we can assess whether the situation there has improved.
we were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at lisbon.
i warmly welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or <UNK> in the crown.
the proposal for a recommendation which you have before you relates to one of the key questions at the heart of our priorities how can we ensure and how can we improve the quality of education.
finally on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles <NUM> and <NUM> of the treaty we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.
of all the issues not dealt with in amsterdam for lack of courage or political will at the time this is undoubtedly the key point and it is indeed the only thing that can prevent and reduce the real risk of deadlock in the enlarged union s decisionmaking process.
mr president we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms.
this is the cornerstone of the programme.
these discussions have already started but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon.
the council rejected all our proposed amendments.
thank you mr wurtz.
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.
but we shall continue to repeat until we are blue in the face that a real european environmental policy can only be applied or even constructed with the necessary funds.
mr president on behalf of the liberal group i would like to welcome greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of greek membership.
it is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justifiable public concern with accurate assessment of the risks.
even if we have new rules of procedure in parliament and it may well be that with such an ambitious chairman in the committee on agriculture problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict cohesion in this parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as i am concerned.
it is not our decision and we have not been involved in any decisionmaking concerning what cuba wants to do.
thank you mrs frassoni for your clarification.
i hope that parliament will adopt this amendment.
we must make ourselves perfectly clear.
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because whether we like it or not the european union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement.
the following concept must be taken into account.
in my own area of activity for example i can tell you that the relationship between youth and sport will be one of the areas focussed on in the forthcoming national and european youth conferences which are being held now in member states and which during the french presidency will be held in paris.
finally in the context of euro <NUM> there is an additional requirement that the stadium must be approved by the european union and uefa.
therefore will the commission state when they intend to propose under article <NUM> that there is the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article <NUM> and urge the council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this treaty to austria including the voting rights of the representative of austria in the council.
unfortunately this seems to apply not only to the public but also to business.
that seems to me to be rather too long.
as far as i know that has still not happened.
however a minimum level of economic convergence is needed to achieve this and also to create a level playing field for the applicant countries and the present eu member states.
during this partsession the european parliament has <UNK> the <UNK> of hypocrisy.
we therefore agree with the reference in amendment no <NUM> to public bodies in general but cannot agree to the specific reference to the police and judicial authorities.
article <NUM> of the conclusions of the helsinki council presidency states that turkey must fulfil the general accession criteria and in particular the copenhagen criteria if it is to become a member of the european union.
this is the first principle.
this was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups.
mr president i would like to put a question to parliament.
nevertheless a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal.
in any event we think it important that the european parliament should express its opinion on the subject in the few days before this conference.
i am sorry mr president to continue from where i left off a moment ago and come back to what mr swoboda just said.
i would point out that the alternative project <NUM> and i would like to thank commissioner kinnock and the chairman mr <UNK> for their efforts here has been examined closely and in great detail by the commission over the past two years and i have also received a written report on this.
it is not enough for the patent office to acknowledge a mistake and make its excuses.
allow me to remind the house agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to rise by <NUM>.
thank you very much commissioner.
the debate is closed.
mr president my task as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market was a relatively easy one compared with that of the honourable members in the committee responsible and i would like to congratulate them all on the outcome even if we do have to discuss a few compromise amendments in plenary today.
those amendments have been incorporated in the commission s amended proposal and subsequently in the common position.
de i have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in austria in view of a possible government being formed between the övp and the fpö.
in doing this we must take into account economic and demographic changes in the union each member state s ability to receive immigrants and the historical and cultural ties that the member state may have with the countries of origin.
there is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a european security policy which is why the european parliament needs to take the lead.
an ambitious and wellbalanced european policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for europe.
i would thank you for your understanding in this matter.
we are now in a position where we can gradually see these governments taking joint steps and the european union setting up a growing common foreign policy.
the debate will be resumed this afternoon.
there has been a <UNK> silence from the commission during the period between then and now.
however in connection with parliaments view of last year i would urge mr duisenberg to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of summary minutes.
greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of <UNK> has a lasting effect.
any idea of a pioneer group does not correspond to the idea of european cooperation that unites us.
even where the countries of the helsinki group are concerned a significant number of dossiers have already been opened and many others have been closed.
as draftsman of the committee on development and cooperation i must not end without asking once again for the cancellation of the foreign debt of the central american countries an initiative which must be dealt with by the european union as a whole and in a coordinated fashion and not only by certain member states acting on individual and particular initiatives.
i also expressly support the view that we should not move away from criminallaw liability.
and we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions.
we must reestablish confidence and that means that as a committee we must make a critical examination of the <NUM> budget.
this is the answer to your first question.
naturally the amount of waste ought also to be reduced.
i regret that this defamation has been echoed in this house and we will send a copy of the court s judgement to the bureau.
but i would like to make clear where the boundary lies.
amendment no <NUM> relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.
this is not and can never be the purpose of intervention in the internal management and particularly the budgetary management of these countries either on the part of the european union or of the member states.
we will no doubt return to these points of criticism in september when we will have the precise figures in front of us.
we have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering.
i am satisfied with the compromise we have reached.
first of all the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised.
it appears from our programming discussions with the south african government that we will have a limited number of major sectoral programmes which we think have to be discussed in any case with the member states.
this is the problem and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the council which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.
this will not take place under the present regime.
we believe that there is an objective need for taiwan to have a greater presence in the international institutions this parliament can promote that.
i personally feel that the best approach is to check that members are present for the vote so that they can leave if they are submitting their explanation in writing and so that the explanations of vote in writing by members who have not taken part in the vote are not counted.
i understand that we must not be inflexible.
formal decisions cannot be taken at these meetings and are in all cases as is in fact stated in the resolution taken by the ecofin council in accordance with the procedures laid down in the treaty.
mr president on the basis of the ombudsman s report and that of mrs thors we may say that the institution of the ombudsman is well established.
that is the most reprehensible thing i have ever heard.
moreover i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
we all know that consensus has still not been reached on this as far as policy is concerned and that that is not going to come about quickly.
if what we want is for the citizens to say yes i have a stake in this european project too then the charter of fundamental rights can help to bring this about.
this is paragraph <NUM> which invites the commission and i quote to be less timid in the use of the periodic penalty payment procedure in accordance with the third paragraph of article <NUM> of the ec treaty.
i would call on the commission to submit proposals to this effect too.
coordination of the railway systems is especially important for those countries and regions which are not situated in the centre of europe.
mr president it has been an interesting debate.
what are we talking about here.
we must also persuade all of our mediterranean partners that the commitments which they have given through taking part in the barcelona process specifically in the field of democracy and human rights are not <UNK>.
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference.
this seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women.
the distribution of child pornography is facilitated by the internet.
i therefore ask the european union during its negotiations to make an extra effort to ensure that this rule is applied to everyone and not just to us.
mr president i would like to stress that in an age of significant technological changes just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.
after all this issue is so important for so many black and poor people.
european council of <NUM> june <NUM>.
it is not just about practical applications but also as you have already mentioned about research.
one of the key factors in the success of the last <NUM> years has been the privatisation of the national stateowned industries which began in the <NUM>.
mr president i would like to thank my socialist colleagues mainly in the committees on transport and the environment who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.
the third aspect i would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of eu policies the central theme of today s debate.
this must be incorporated into the cornerstones of economic policy.
it is for these reasons that british conservatives have voted against the malmström resolution.
the future will show whether it is right by means of this new parliamentary assembly to reduce the commission s powers regarding these issues.
in accordance with article <NUM> of the treaty the auditing of accounts is carried out by the court of auditors which to this end studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions.
when it comes to the balkans and kosovo i also hope that the council will comply with parliament s and as i understand it also the commission s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in kosovo.
we are all acting as if this is not really happening but we all know that it is.
mr president commissioner i should like to thank the rapporteur mrs schierhuber for this report not least because it takes into consideration processing in those countries in particular which as members of the eu have also taken up the cultivation of flax.
it is continuing to work on an independent basis.
what has happened with the euro.
i would thank the president of the council for that answer.
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply which i find extremely satisfactory.
we must not hesitate to clamp down on any form of <UNK> and polarisation.
i would like to point out however that women in particular are being disproportionately affected by discrimination and among women as a group it is especially women and girls who are often doubly discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnic origin.
some representatives of the european council cannot stand the prospect of being forced to vote and they <UNK> of the nature of the convention itself.
so this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous.
i wish to point out that parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject.
if this request is made by <NUM> members i can check on the quorum.
madam president this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.
thirdly i am aware of your concern in relation to <UNK> furniture and other items and these are being kept under review.
i believe that if it is understood properly the regional approach is both important and necessary.
as you have pointed out very well the number of deaths on european roads caused by excessive alcohol consumption has risen to <NUM> <NUM>.
i do not propose at this point to start yet another discussion on the effectiveness of the methods at our disposal for dealing with crises.
secondly in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years we consider that the main question to be considered by the commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the eu which neither the programme nor the motion mention.
we are already making the necessary preparations which is why we also need the strong guidelines planned by the main rapporteur in the fisheries sector.
we therefore still have a great deal to do if we are to achieve the target of <NUM> which the programme is aiming for.
the second principle in the council s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.
the possibility of giving an explanation was raised and i argued that that would mean a new vote.
mr president one other brief point.
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.
the important thing from our mutual point of view is that when the time comes we can either in committee or in plenary session have a debate on the conditions which i hope will be those we have agreed with the people s republic of china and that this will be completely transparent.
the next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the commission.
in short what is the origin of investments in the commercial field.
in your review of information policy i would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain member states.
mr president with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights the reality always seems to be ahead of the regulations.
the purpose of the three main amendments i support is as follows.
none of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue.
do they really wish taking the example of the french government to have to face twenty problems such as the case of the <UNK> all at the same time.
clearly the legal affairs committee can vote on anything but since it was not laid down and since it was dealing with such an important and serious issue which did not appear in the agenda it did not seem to me to be reasonable to hold a vote if we were taking a route which all the speakers and this is recorded in the minutes for one reason or another rejected.
we would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the eu s activities but consider that social policy is mainly a question for each individual member state to decide upon.
at that time she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.
i know the committee on agriculture tells us that we are having the wrong debate in defending an increase in the budget in the context of these reports.
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities.
the fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.
as i have already said we intend to present the communication before the end of the year and we also intend to analyse not only the particular issues affecting the sensitive areas but also the possible concrete solutions in the field of more suitable infrastructures funding use and safety.
as far as businesses are concerned research work must be encouraged.
it would probably have taken until the end of the last century to <UNK> the marshall plan aid.
mr president allow me on behalf of the european parliament to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.
mr president on behalf of the pse group i would like to thank the rapporteur for the comprehensive extremely important and highly informative work that he has carried out.
the union must react and the commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens.
ladies and gentlemen today on behalf of the council presidency it is my honour to present the draft budget of the european communities as drawn up by the council on <NUM> july.
in february we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in <NUM> which we would like to expand.
there are situations such as that in the horn of africa which cover more than one state.
i agree that it is a matter for concern that rules on the transport of animals are not being sufficiently enforced in certain areas.
our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof.
what we need most of all is for the member states to devote more energy to implementing community legislation and for environmental interests to be integrated into other policy areas more effectively so as to ensure that economic growth and environmental damage are no longer two sides of the same coin.
the sitting was closed at <NUM> pm.
i hope the <UNK> of my congratulations does not diminish the <UNK> of them.
i would like to remind the commission of article <NUM> ex article <NUM> of the treaty which lays down that social and economic cohesion must be strengthened and the differences in levels of development between the different regions and the underdevelopment of the leastfavoured regions including the rural areas should be reduced.
we are prepared to reach an agreement with the council.
we do not want to lose time.
<NUM> by posselt on behalf of the ppede group.
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.
mr president on a point of order.
what we managed to achieve at the meeting last week in lisbon was an important step forward.
the commission has discussed precisely this today as part of the debate on the revision of the financial regulation and i can assure you that we intend to change the rules in order to tighten up the time scale.
we need to take a long hard look at ourselves before we are in a position to establish realistic criteria.
let me mention your laudable efforts to support us and to support the building of democracy by the legislative council in our country on the one hand and your support for the peace process on the other and the invitation to mr burg and myself to establish dialogue with you.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us.
it is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts.
what does the commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term.
in the shorter term for pragmatic reasons we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme.
we have just received the reply of the german government to the observations made.
the vote will take place during the next partsession.
the dogma of liberal globalisation has <UNK> the free movement of goods and capital but is seeking to stop the free movement of people.
indeed i am forced to observe that this was not the case when the commission drew up its communication published on <NUM> october last year.
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.
i should like to say in passing that i would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the norwegian government which regularly reminds us by its behaviour on the international stage what we are all missing in the european union on account of the norwegian people s referendum decision.
while there are some aspects of the report which i believe would be better dealt with in a different way overall i believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.
on the subject of akin birdal again we fully share the concerns that have been expressed during the debate and in the resolution on the return to prison of akin birdal ostensibly to complete his sentence.
to complement this a transparent benchmarking system must be established in order to assess the progress made by member states in achieving these objectives.
madam president i notice that you have not called mr hernández mollar who had asked me to speak on his behalf.
this does not only involve monitoring the european union s points of entry but also monitoring what is happening within our member states particularly with regard to the illegal labour market.
having failed to do the same the house has at least adopted some of their ideas most of which we were pleased to see have been incorporated in the common position.
the key question is how we turn the conclusions of the lisbon summit into action we must ensure that we turn the rhetoric of lisbon into a reality.
otherwise we will in many cases only be repairing the damage inflicted as a consequence of our own policy and the people in the countries of the south in particular will suffer as a result of the disasters which we have caused.
mr president ladies and gentlemen some of the amendments tabled water down the substance and the objective of the council s proposal for a regulation on beef labelling.
in view of the time available given that as you know we have a commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current list already includes two items we can only add two additional items.
at this point i would particularly like to mention the common foreign and security policy which follows on from the implementation of the conclusions of the helsinki and cologne summits and has made good progress under the portuguese presidency.
mr president i want first of all to say thank you to mrs lienemann for her report.
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour.
yes but the problem of course is that this is what we are concerned with here.
it is now scheduled for july.
for that reason i feel very positive about the council s common position with regard to tyre noise.
mr seixas da costa had informed us that he had to leave at <NUM> pm.
parliament adopted the resolution.
furthermore since i have had the honour of working with him on previous annual reports on human rights i know how difficult it is.
in this respect parliament s contribution is an extremely important element in this process.
on behalf of the house i would like to welcome you to the european parliament.
in the next few days it will shoulder its responsibilities and will in the spirit that i have just mentioned launch a <UNK> initiative with the reservation that i mentioned right at the beginning of my speech which is the coordination that there must be between us with all the institutions.
we therefore have an obligation to respond to these concerns in a way that will guarantee the protection of the environment and public health with a view to improving the quality of our citizens lives.
mr president i do not want to <UNK> the house too long but i think that mr hannan protests too much.
the second reason is that if this danish initiative is implemented it will facilitate paneuropean environmental cooperation in the council of europe and perhaps enable this convention to be complied with.
it is <UNK> on a number of points especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of and conditions for implementing the derogations.
it is only natural and very sensible that sweden should do the same but this should be possible without <UNK> the rules for the free movement of goods which as has been mentioned before is one of the european union s cornerstones.
it has taken another two and a half years for the council to adopt a common position which is before us today.
i am thinking of the organisation of an international conference involving poor countries the pharmaceutical industries the ngos and the donors.
that in my judgement is the challenge for the next few weeks.
we are in the process of achieving these at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year.
we must not get ahead of ourselves.
this house should certainly not get into the habit of letting subjects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the week go by the board.
we are all austrians because the european union is a single entity in terms of rights and citizenship and i would like to have the same rights in austria that austrian citizens should have in my country.
at the same time as the areas in which the european union is becoming involved are expanding the citizens are demanding quite rightly that it should be more democratic more transparent and more efficient and that it should be more diligent in respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
i should like to say however that the agreement is in certain respects a disappointment in the perspective of what has happened in the baltic.
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.
i think the time is right to clearly reiterate the terms of the unequivocal declaration adopted by the berlin european council in march <NUM> in which the fifteen stated that they were ready to recognise a palestinian state.
the issue is as topical as it was before.
we must send out a positive political message by giving our assent.
the impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance.
the main aim of this year of languages is as has already been said to urge the people of europe to learn several languages both for their own benefit as the basis for improved understanding and integration within the european union.
moreover i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.
the nationals of noneu states who live in the union must be treated on an equal footing with the citizens of the member states with regard to access to education health and social protection.
you are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a european identity.
madam president ladies and gentlemen i particularly welcome this opportunity to say before i start that the portuguese government fully shares the sentiments expressed in the tribute paid to mr pflimlin and that we too wish to express our sincere condolences to his family and to his country.
madam president i should like to make a request in connection with today s vote which i started to make yesterday during the debate on the equal report.
for the moment of course the commission has neither the manpower nor the financial resources to take responsibility for such a task.
nevertheless i must say that what we have witnessed in peru is nothing new.
i shall be particularly grateful to commissioner barnier if he can tell us whether the commission has looked at this aspect of the problem in the context of the <UNK> of competition policy and if he could tell us where the commission has got to in its thinking on this subject.
regarding amendment no <NUM> the commission takes note of the committee s concern about the level of support for long fibres but must just point out again that obviously it will be impossible to evaluate the situation in full if a report has to be drawn up on it only a year after the reform.
i think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity.
i do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the council presidency because my government intervened at the request of and in conjunction with fourteen member states and not in its presidency capacity.
when the commission then <UNK> to complain about the questionnaires and working papers of the members of the committee on budgetary control that shows that something has gone wrong with the flow of information between the controlling and the controlled parties and this must be rectified as quickly as possible.
the postponement and the response time given to the commission allow it to answer the questions from the committee on budgetary control within the set time.
it is true that some have left.
at the moment there are agricultural sectors in the mediterranean and also in the outermost regions of the community which could be threatened as a result of the very generous proposed concessions by the commission.
i would therefore like to congratulate both the danish government on the initiative it has undertaken and the honourable members mr di lello finuoli and mrs schörling who have used their texts to broaden and specify the scope of the initiative.
in view of the coming review of the policy in <NUM> it is important that we have all possible information economic as well as biological.
it is important that the general rules governing the granting of community financial aid to the transeuropean networks are strictly complied with.
furthermore i also wish to recognise the positive and cooperative attitude of the commission to whom commissioner i would like to express my personal thanks.
as i have said before our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right.
therefore the commission cannot accept amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM>.
the work of this convention has not yet been completed.
there is still a great deal of work to be done on the <UNK> of our past.
i have therefore voted in favour of it.
another very important issue is the status of jerusalem which requires a compromise.
the fact that parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important.
i have repeatedly stressed that enlargement is the commission s single most important task and that the commission is committed to starting the process off along the right track.
in view of the time voting time will be suspended now and resumed at <NUM> pm.
thank you very much mrs morgan.
mr president commissioner i would firstly like to congratulate mrs lienemann on the report she has carried out and also the commission why not because this report this position generally improves on the texts in force.
mr casaca i can assure you that despite everything i am not pessimistic about the way in which the european union has been progressing towards establishing an ethical dimension and in particular towards <UNK> itself with legal mechanisms to enable it to cope with new situations such as the ones you have mentioned.
we need to upgrade this committee if we are to <UNK> omissions in the practical application of community law.
i hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an <UNK> end to this.
however there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union.
mr president i have problems with the <UNK> of regulation <NUM> of <NUM> to which the resolution before us refers.
this policy will of course become more difficult to implement without the protection of import restrictions which is the reason why sweden has wished either to retain the derogation on a permanent basis or as the swedish government has now agreed with the commission at least to be given a number of additional years in which to phase out the derogation.
that is why i cannot take it now.
in the case of crime policy fighting the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of europol alone.
of course there is no problem with the general aims of the report.
this is one of the most important questions of all in every election campaign in sweden and in other countries.
the honourable member asked me how i saw the relationship between the institutions between the council the commission and parliament.
in conclusion i would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single european sky by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution.
we constantly find ourselves having to deal with this contradiction particularly as regards the rights of the child an area where there are cases in which more than one country is involved and in which the victims are not only not notified by the state where the judgement is made but are also deprived of legal support.
this is a key priority for us to focus on.
the council s proposal must comply with legislation of the national member states in the field of criminal law.
i think that a common strategy would be needed to deal with these issues.
there is also a controversy over the relationship between the new european union charter and the existing european convention of human rights.
we therefore urgently need an integrated and cohesive community policy on children and it is really sad as others too have said that the treaty of amsterdam does not provide the necessary legal base.
i am firmly convinced that the political will that was present in this agreement will also be present when it comes to implementing it.
i hope that is not the case but the risk is there.
we have a similar problem in many border regions and i would refer in this regard to mr paasilinna s intervention.
in this case we have almost <NUM> projects which were approved in due time and which are to be financed by the ecip.
for twenty years the european union has shown itself to be zimbabwe s leading partner in its development.
the uk government of course was part of the problem.
these are the key points which i would like to highlight here.
this is not provided for in the treaty of amsterdam.
i think it is absolutely excellent that we should have different rules about chocolate in different member states.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the european union s <UNK> determination to have an ambitious mediterranean policy is not a new one at least in terms of the speeches made and the declarations of intent and our discussions this evening only confirm this.
i would like to say that it is my intention that initiatives taken during the portuguese presidency should start and move ahead quickly and with a substantial input of work.
i am of the opinion that the fund should finance measures to inform the public concerning the policy and practice of the member states with regard to refugees asylum seekers and other temporarily protected persons.
yet we must also remember that we managed to get nearly four million tonnes of food to subsaharan africa thanks to action by the international community.
i said that we would end at <NUM> pm and we have respected this timetable.
in my opinion the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights we always focus on individual rights and too often disregard the rights of peoples.
i should also like to thank you mr casaca for your report.
we need a basic legislative framework for ecommerce.
in any case we call for an increase in the budget and we hope that parliament and the commission will be able to achieve unanimity and an agreement on this issue as well.
at european level the european parliament has been calling for the <NUM> directive to be updated since <NUM>.
mr president i too regret the absence of the commissioner here this evening.
that is what we are dealing with creating a common airspace which can be used flexibly.
the internal market is a reality now.
in fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now.
this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective <NUM> region that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and mediumsized enterprises.
thank you mr miller.
so we must take the time to reflect carefully about what we are doing.
it is a matter that has been of significant concern to the industry committee.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr maccormick on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the request for waiver of the immunity of <UNK> brie.
for this reason the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades.
madam president many observers have stressed the fact that the special summit was characterised by the triumph of the <UNK> of mr blair and mr aznar.
it is totally in the hands of parliament as it should be.
the european union is something much greater than that it has a common origin and a dream which we must fight to realise and civil rights are an integral part of that fight.
i think that this means that we are on the right track.
but i can imagine that other people would argue against this saying no it is important to be involved in this as a union.
how do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded.
therefore i consider that the commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and from every point of view is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately.
we are voting on a parliament budget to the tune of nearly eur <NUM> billion.
this report will form the basis of a draft directive.
the european union acquired a new remit following the war in kosovo and the resolutions on the stability pact in the balkans.
the eu must not start competing with the existing authorities for resolving disputes such as the court of human rights here in strasbourg.
accordingly in response to the commission s action we have met with a <UNK> of contradictory research studies.
in addition to this i welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters occurring within our nations has been <UNK> in the budget.
it must now during this stage make an additional effort to apply the commitments it has made and to demonstrate the necessary willingness to comply with its multilateral obligations and to respect the rules and instructions of the world trade organisation.
i want the assembly to stop being just a <UNK> and become a <UNK> for the <UNK> of all the people in developing countries.
we are prepared to withdraw our motion for a resolution if the other groups do the same and to try to work constructively together.
parliament gave its assent.
resumption of the session.
we also congratulate you for using olive oil which is very good for the health.
in our view practically all the financial resources for civil crisis management have been at the disposal of the commission s budget to date.
mr president i also warmly congratulate the rapporteur who has shown enormous commitment to this report.
even if the best preventive measures are taken there will never be no risk at all of accidents.
mr president i have asked for the floor in order to add to mrs napoletano s words.
then another proposal for a temporary committee of inquiry was tabled by our fellow member mr barón crespo.
through the agreement the european parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under article <NUM> of the treaty.
this is the best way to help peru and therefore the european union must make an effort so that its influence in latin america may counteract so many years of anomalies and suffering and favour harmonious economic development democracy and the consolidation of human rights.
but we regret that it <UNK> to the rights of national minorities an expression that is far more restrictive than the universal concept of human rights.
secondly on a matter of communication under paragraph <NUM> of this resolution i would like to draw the houses attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all commission and parliament offices in the member states to work together within a european house framework by <NUM> january <NUM>.
we must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process so that wealth does not only benefit the most highlydeveloped blocks and countries but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.
it is common ground that in the face of all those challenges the way the european union functions at present is certainly in need of some changes changes whose important aim will be the future progress of the european union on the basis of what we have all accepted until now.
on behalf of my group i would say that this question was somewhat superfluous.
the fundamental point that we have to bear in mind here is that whilst europe has made enormous progress in economic terms as regards the single market and the single currency nothing or next to nothing has been done in the field of justice and home affairs.
the present proposal is important to both producers and consumers and is welcomed by the liberal group.
thank you very much mr president for allowing me to speak.
collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital.
obviously i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.
of course the <NUM> <NUM> tonnes of emergency aid promised by the international community must be delivered as soon as possible.
this leads me to say that first and foremost the commission has taken account of the council s wish that it present as economical a budget as possible.
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which <UNK> the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decisionmaking process for the spending of such funds.
mr president i too should like to congratulate mr van velzen on an excellent report.
the committee on agriculture agreed on the wording by <NUM> january <NUM> at the latest in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin ie stage <NUM>.
by this i mean the large number of refugees and displaced persons who have had to be <UNK> the fact that most of the infrastructure has been destroyed the strength of feeling that still exists in every section of kosovo s population the fact that the economy has collapsed and the total lack of internal tax income.
you will undoubtedly know that there is a quorum if one third of the meps are present in the chamber.
i am pleased to learn of the intentions which he announced on behalf of the commission which are generally in line with those of the french presidency.
the zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future.
i am pleased to report that we are at one with the council on this point and i am sure that we shall be able to implement some of the commitments and objectives formulated in lisbon in the forthcoming budget in a spirit of partnership and consistency.
i say this in relation to the provan report and the reform of the voting system in parliament.
it attracted broad support and was also in line with the accepted practices of a number of member states.
we shall have to vote on these amendments but in another report.
the committee on agriculture and rural development is right in saying that the commission is acting in an absurd manner.
i am not one of those meps who thinks that it is essential to adopt extremist amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the council of ministers.
instead they also affect the whole of europe.
several member states have already imposed a ban on phthalates in toys for children under the age of three.
that is the sort of message we want to hear.
if everything that has been said here can facilitate a convergence of the positions of both parliament and the commission and if mr knörr borràs and the ppe can withdraw the amendments i have mentioned we believe that this would allow us to make progress with the adoption of the text which will without doubt be positive in terms of clarifying future accounts.
mr president i would personally like to congratulate jacob söderman on the good work he has done which resulted in his <UNK> on <NUM> october last year.
i know no better than you if this charter will become part of the treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration.
it the report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in europe will be accompanied by an <UNK> process of cohesion.
that is why we can only hope and we should resolve all of this this week that in <NUM> we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.
subject drafting of the charter of fundamental rights the general public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up.
i congratulate him and the other rapporteur mr <UNK> for the commitment and dedication which they have shown.
this has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.
this could be achieved by creating a european civil security force and we shall continue to advance this idea which we shall keep you informed of in the coming months.
mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs rothbehrendt according to a <UNK> saying prevention is better than cure and i assume that this <UNK> of wisdom is used in each of our member states and regions.
i would also like to thank parliament for its efforts in solving the problem of financial support for montenegro which we felt was essential in order to send a very clear message to all those who are trying to establish democracy in that area.
given such a situation how are we to interpret the french presidency s recent initiative to go to berlin and announce a completely different agenda for the future of the union.
i have drawn it up and it will soon be put before parliament.
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on <NUM> march of this year.
it does not remain within the strict limits of compliance with our international obligations but it is taking a political decision which would lead as mr fernández martín pointed out to the dismantling of the whole of our community agricultural policy.
there are a number of individual points that have been mentioned that i would like to draw attention to and see if i can respond to the questions raised.
parliament adopted the legislative resolution.
<NUM> by mr <UNK> and others on behalf of the technical group of independent members on the need to stop chinese colonisation and adopt a new statute for tibet.
the committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the commission s proposal more stringent.
thank you mrs mccarthy.
i am not in a position at this point to go into the individual points of the resolution in detail.
rather it is a question of operating outside the eu s borders.
in fact i consider it essential for the council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an austrian government which includes members of the austrian freedom party.
as far as the institutions to be set up in the near future referred to today are concerned i am afraid that we will paint ourselves into a corner.
i have in mind a voluntary agreement according to which <NUM> or <NUM> of the funds would be used for research training and further education and for new infrastructure.
there is no record of this in the verbatim report of proceedings.
may i repeat that on monday he will be available to the committee on regional policy transport and tourism of parliament.
as for the involvement of the european parliament in this process it should be recalled that the common european security and defence policy is a component of the common foreign and security policy.
this is not a final decision.
mr presidentinoffice of the council firstly i would like to thank the presidencyinoffice of the council for their high level presence in this house and for their positive attitude.
cooperation with civil society which is one of the points raised in another question is still an essential element in the development of the third chapter of the barcelona process.
so the question is why has the portuguese presidency not adopted initiatives to ensure that a proposal would be put forward with due haste.
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.
secondly as far as financial assistance is concerned a distinction should be made between everyone and those who need this financial assistance.
the directive was supposed to have come from the commission for a reading in the european parliament in july and now we have heard that it is probably being postponed until september.
i nevertheless believe that the council intends to highlight these different national approaches which reflect the very diverse nature of the european union.
you should remember that we have a limited capacity for intervention in certain areas and that as was said today in other respects the difficulties in the eu s external action framework and the financing of this framework limit the eu s capacity to be present in all conflict situations.
subject implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey given that turkey has recently been granted applicant country status what is the commissions view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam given the massive displacement of the kurdish and the other people of the region that will result.
now before we start thinking about strengthening these measures as far as the commission is concerned it appears important to ensure that they are also put into practice in an effective manner particularly by the developing countries.
i have recently had occasion to reflect on the increasingly important continuum of interaction between the european institutions.
following a request for participation by norway the commission submitted to the european parliament a draft agreement between the european monitoring centre and norway authorising norway to participate in the reitox network and to be represented on the management board of the european monitoring centre as well as on its scientific committee.
the absurdity of this system is becoming increasingly apparent.
however i have not been able to vote for it because it still contains inconsistencies after the plenary vote.
mr president i must apologise for this appearing to be a british show at this moment.
the most significant legacy of the european council s summit in lisbon is all the unresolved problems.
in this respect i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs <UNK> and mr huhne of monitoring implementation.
this is a plan which can be used as a benchmark.
nor does it fall in with the need to prioritise those measures which provide the greatest benefits in terms of cost.
i can foresee a large role for such an observatory and i would therefore like to see a proactive approach to dealing with it and i would call on <UNK> the organisation of european employers in particular to show more commitment and some more enthusiasm.
given that express reference is made to the fact that current economic policy is guided by the objectives of the stability pact and the commission wants to go further still then it is obvious that social cultural and environmental needs will inevitably be sacrificed to this as a matter of principle.
i must make it clear that the commission has simply said that it would use available funds and that savings would be made in the common agricultural policy.
i am aware of the difficulties the council experienced in finding a compromise.
concerning the situation in estonia i would point out that the excise tariffs which apply to beer in that country are already somewhat higher than the minimum tariffs laid down in community law.
however we should wait until the commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money.
i think our acp partners will also be pleased with the outcome of this vote.
penalties are therefore essential and they need to be designed to act as a deterrent and to be proportional to the damage to citizens quality of life.
mr president commissioner i too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal.
i shall simply stress my own personal complaint because in the end we did not manage to adopt a review clause.
<NUM> by mr davies and mrs attwooll on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party on the additionality principle in structural fund appropriations.
the commission is highly concerned with this event which raises questions in relation to nuclear safety.
restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.
it is a question of creating confidence in development if ecommerce is to work.
it is not fair that the state and local authorities should be required to a great extent to take the place of the polluter in meeting expenses.
mr kronberger mr messner and mrs gonzález álvarez mentioned the important issues of climate and i would like to say that there is probably somewhere a link between the consequences of these natural disasters and the policies for which europe must remain one of the driving forces for prevention in terms of the major environmental issues.
i want once more to express my thanks for the report and for the very interesting debate today.
this should also be <UNK> in the mind of the parliamentary delegation due to travel to the war zone over the coming weeks.
we are not currently in a position to assess the results of the <NUM> projects cofinanced by the commission since the projects only started at the beginning of the year.
i would therefore advise you to contact mr poos so that he can keep you informed of the situation.
it is vital to support the wahid government at present.
what i want to say is that all those who support the idea of a european monitoring centre agree on its mission and its form.
we have been doing that for years.
this is obviously an extraordinarily large step in the right direction.
we in the group of the european people s party consider it necessary to support the main lines set in the commission s proposal especially with regard to target levels which coincide with the guidelines of the world health organisation on air quality and which establish the permissible concentrations of ozone at <NUM> <NUM>.
the committee is aware that the decree of the prime minister of the french republic of which mr le pen was notified on <NUM> april <NUM> and which was published in the official journal of the french republic on <NUM> april <NUM> has become enforceable.
mr president i must thank the commissioner for being present in this almost <UNK> chamber on a thursday evening.
this is why information campaigns are essential.
if we are to strengthen the second pillar then it must be made equivalent to the first and built up accordingly that is it must take account of the biometric risks.
i am up to a point concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process.
on the first question i am going myself to kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and i will certainly look into the <UNK> made by the honourable member about the echo food package.
if compatibility is to be achieved the specifications of a range of technical components need to be brought into line with one another.
car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of reuse recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.
one important area is that of educational initiatives and it is perhaps especially important to prepare for the enlargement of the union towards the east.
the risks of <UNK> disasters must not be ignored and in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the speed of intervention that they require i think that the community would do well to have these resources again.
however we will not manage it by the end of the year <NUM>.
i would like to point out although you already know that the president together with her office decides on the order of questions.
i can only assume that the tdi group must.
with regard to the reference to the cultural economy and new technologies this should also be included in the lisbon report and my view is that we will be able to use these bases to boost employment substantially.
ii the council common position for adopting a european parliament and council directive relating to the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity the levying of charges for the use of the railway infrastructure and safety certification <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president during the most recent meeting of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism i was <UNK> surprised.
i am sorry.
what should the commission s role be in this.
this is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each member state.
the programmes are to be updated and revised by <NUM>.
we feel that these decisions are crucial in terms of the reform of the union without them any discussion of its structure will be academic and it is clear that now that the single currency and the central bank have been established europe is in need of new political unity and as has been said a fresh boost for economic growth and social cohesion.
madam president we are therefore working on this issue with determination energy and the full support of all the governments and all the heads of government.
it indicates the commission s high level of commitment to this issue.
the african countries considered this to be one of the most important milestones of this summit.
the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
we should be very clear about this too so as to ensure that these issues are brought into line.
and how should we achieve this.
if we really want to help the countries devastated by the hurricane then of course we need to do more than just implement a few aid projects on the ground.
we are nonetheless abstaining from voting in the final vote because we believe that labour market legislation is an area to which the subsidiarity principle ought to be applied as mentioned in paragraph <NUM>.
i do not consider creating a european administrative law to be appropriate.
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do.
this is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group.
we are quite clear about the fact that these provisions are aimed especially at the new member states whose legal arrangements differ from those of the eu countries.
it has dealt with virtually all the important issues that the commission is concerned with in the broader sense.
pt i have two points to make mr seppänen.
i am not going to debate it.
at the level of the wto the bilateral negotiations now occurring are just one step towards the <UNK> of the agreed mechanisms and towards the finalisation of the process in geneva.
this is then a matter of improving road safety in the eu which is vital.
it seems to me to be a very comprehensive report and to make some very striking points.
it is important for us to remember that this is a framework.
i am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework.
it is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.
they cannot therefore be approved.
i just wish to congratulate the commissioner on his replies.
the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country spain and in belgium are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.
investments are already being made in anticipation of the directive.
the european commission has also commissioned a study.
i will own up to the fact that i have omitted to table a motion for a split vote on behalf of my group.
although i did not join the european parliament until last year i happen to know that the handling of this annual human rights report has over the past couple of years always met with a great deal of political commotion and confusion.
these measures on the conservation of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained.
what are the councils views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union.
once again towards the end of this year the commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes and i am obviously available for any discussion with parliament on that report.
in the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the eu.
with regard to this i would just like to mention a specific point given that a great many references have been made to the united states.
it is true that we currently spend usd <NUM> million per year on africa but at the same time africa has a debt of usd <NUM> billion owed to the industrialised countries.
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.
we could of course say that it is not our problem and the fact that it is not prepared to make progress in this area more obvious and is not creating the political institutions for doing so is indeed turkey s own biggest problem.
it is intolerable that the european parliament should ask us to breach the provisions of this constitution which is one of the most democratic and advanced constitutions in the world.
the high representative is particularly committed to issues of this kind and took part in the last meeting held in moscow of the ministerial steering committee which gave fresh impetus to the multilateral track of the middle east peace process in which the european union is involved.
i think that now would be the ideal time for the european parliament to issue a statement to this effect.
at present we are putting together a package on the new legislation.
we would start by pointing out that as far as we are concerned the matter is not technical it is highly political.
i have therefore taken recourse to rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure and proposed an amendment to the rules of procedure.
they cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region though i must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to <UNK> the state of yugoslavia.
i very much welcome this opportunity to speak to the european parliament just a couple of days after the informal meeting of foreign ministers in evian at which there was a serious discussion on the effectiveness and efficiency of the european unions external activities and the budgetary consequences the first time to my knowledge that such a discussion has taken place.
mr president i wanted to bring up an issue which should be of great concern to this parliament and in particular to members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the committee on budgetary control.
first of all this matter has been in the pipeline since <NUM> so it has not really been <UNK> on any other commodity producers.
under article <NUM> the commission is obliged to supervise state aid.
furthermore it is important to remember that <NUM> will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and i anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at helsinki.
mr president commissioner thank you for your reply but i would like to say very briefly that now as the eu is enlarging to the east in accordance with a very tight timetable and they have been transporting horses from the baltic countries among others into the eu area on journeys of up to a hundred hours long i think it is quite odd that at the same time we are calling on applicant countries to adhere very closely to the guidelines and legal provisions.
adjournment of the session.
so it is obvious how important this investment is for the european union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.
there has been some discussion that the transfer of power from the council to the commission might not be such a good thing.
within the commission the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.
in this way payments made at the end of the programming period as was the case the previous year are avoided.
these products are manufactured by small and mediumsized enterprises.
the mutual interdependence of issues pertaining to the national economy employment policy and social protection in the internal market calls for there to be joint deliberations at community level in this respect.
i would also like to say to these members if they had worked like i have in recent months and if they had been given the mandate from the electorate personally they would behave differently today.
i hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the european union charter on fundamental rights.
this is why i congratulate mr napolitano s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen and the european parliament.
in that connection we must honour the additional protocol of the treaty of amsterdam according to which member states decide how to organise public service finances.
this exercise is a demonstration of the member states intention to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that lies ahead.
this is not the time as others have suggested to have the kind of <UNK> delays that we have seen from the council neither is it the time for political <UNK> by other institutions of the european union.
we believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions.
on behalf of the council minister you informed us that the immigration policy and the fight against crimes related to illegal immigration are two separate issues.
i am still confused about the situation in relation to mince.
that is why i would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going that is with regard to political relations that is.
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax.
i think therefore that parliament too in tandem with the commission and the council cannot work fast enough on this score because the world will not wait for us.
the police within the european union work differently from the police in some candidate countries as other meps have already pointed out.
however it ought to be beyond all doubt that at the same time as a document is given to someone outside the commission parliament should have the right to the same information.
i think that we must avoid this danger.
the european parliament is in fact only consulted on the occasion of bilateral agreements.
the impact of enlargement on the budget was the subject of intense discussion at the european council in berlin in march <NUM> when the financial perspectives for <NUM> were drawn up.
we must gain in credibility and act clearly and <UNK> in the interests of democracy and the rule of law.
all in all it is a reasonable result and i repeat it is a result which will mainly help smes in the union.
nevertheless given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of european construction this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.
the disappearance of internal borders and the creation of the area of freedom security and justice require us to make an effort to harmonise our asylum and immigration policies and to reinforce checks at external borders.
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.
more significantly under amendment no <NUM> the fisheries committee accepts the recommendation of the budgets committee that the funding should be placed under heading <NUM> rather than heading <NUM> of the financial perspective.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
i would like to ask the portuguese presidency do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference in the form of a recommendation in this respect.
does the commission realise that such a measure would be inconsistent with the commission s recent eeurope initiative the aim of which was to encourage the use of the internet both by private individuals and by businesses.
i only have time to mention a couple of points.
this is an important topic but also an extremely complicated one.
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.
mr president commissioner liikanen ladies and gentlemen firstly i would like to congratulate the rapporteur mr van velzen warmly on his report which brings out <UNK> and precisely the essential elements of the extensive and complex communication from the commission and also forms an accurate assessment of them.
regarding immigration and asylum the commission intends to present proposals for creating a community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the dublin convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the union and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.
this is a clearly a matter in which the european union must intervene on account of the subsidiarity principle.
i am of course very happy that the new common position has been established by the council and that it has strengthened the position as compared with the past.
the commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve amendments <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM>.
mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done.
we abstained on the gue resolution because although we agree with a number of its criticisms of the commission in the recitals the commission is described as an indispensable interinstitutional instrument which is not how we see it.
we have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability.
according to experts in the world health organisation it is not possible to prove that phthalates are <UNK>.
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the <UNK> of legislation.
we are the representatives of the people.
it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of europe in the <NUM> century.
unfortunately i have to say that i am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market resolved on unanimously and i would like to stand by this outcome which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.
with regard to the internal market the european council adopted ambitious objectives in the field of procurement and in order to implement action plans for financial services and risk capital.
that is an alternative recipe for economic policy but one which is contrary to the treaty.
this is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the united states.
the only way to improve the centre s work is by ensuring that the information provided by member states and the regulations governing the centre are ever more thorough and reliable.
the european union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former yugoslavia.
i hope that the commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time because here too i repeat this is breach of contract.
the question then arises does the commission have room for manoeuvre in this respect.
however we do criticise the way in which it has been implemented.
as representative of the eldr group i wish to defend the abolition of competition distortion as well as the principle of free trade which however must benefit the public.
i also feel however that the commission did an excellent job whether or not you agree with the solutions put forward in the document adopted on <NUM> january.
against the committee on budgetary control s judgement we rejected the european parliament s discharge and we formulated five requests for the secretarygeneral of this parliament.
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we are just about to vote for the <UNK> time on a resolution concerning tibet and we have to say if we examine the effect these have had in the past it is exceptionally poor.
i should like briefly to go into the individual proposals in the bösch report which now come within a wider context this applies for example to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the european court of auditors.
i am extremely surprised at the proposals which would give members of the european parliament the right to participate in the appointment of the judges.
i am not trying to start a debate on this subject now but i would like you to clarify this once and for all because there has been a lot of confusion here today.
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the council of ministers.
in the second place you also mentioned safeguarding the european social model reiterating the conclusions of the lisbon summit which we feel are a move in the right direction the direction of defending the <UNK> of employment social cohesion and competitivity.
it is indeed true that the language problems are considerable.
we must of course stress that the environmental aid granted continues to concentrate on the water sector despite the need in many other cases for other measures to preserve protect and improve the quality of the environment and the rational <UNK> of natural resources as laid down in article <NUM> of the treaty which refers to <UNK> land reclamation etc.
our aim must be to fully integrate fisheries and environmental policy into eu policy and let us not wait until the next millennium to do so.
but the question is now is the european union doing anything about it as well.
therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of parliament.
we must also fight for an end to the impunity with which acts of genocide and war crimes have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the tribunals so that they may be judged.
we are not asking any more than our right but we are hoping that the decent people of the world will not give up on this either.
fr mr president i too would like to thank mr valdivielso de cué and congratulate him on his excellent work.
therefore madam president i believe that we should clearly point out to the tunisian government which is a friendly government and is associated to us that this behaviour is not only incompatible with our association agreement but that also as mr wurtz has rightly pointed out that this situation should not be allowed to continue and is leading ben brik s relatives to endanger their own lives in defence of these rights.
we are dismayed at the <UNK> reporting of the conference held by the <UNK> <UNK> foundation in berlin and we are deeply concerned about the arrests of journalists and critical intellectuals in the wake of this conference.
the helsinki declaration which was approved by the heads of state and government of the fifteen expressly states that the european union recognises the primary responsibility of the united nations security council for the maintenance of international peace and security.
i am satisfied from the advice that i get from my service and the other information that is made available to me that any measures that are necessary are being taken.
in my view it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the union to the citizens of cyprus and malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.
i am not so sure.
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we were more than happy to endorse this report because we believe that environmental crime is still being underestimated that its effects often go <UNK> and liability is sometimes difficult to establish.
furthermore the portuguese presidency intends to submit in due course for the council s consideration initial ideas on the possibility of developing general principles on data protection which would apply to all the instruments of the third pillar.
he has done an enormous amount of work on the amendments to reach a compromise.
why should we do this.
my plea to the council would be that it should debate this regulation as soon as possible.
the answer is simple i am speaking on behalf of <NUM> countries.
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more <UNK> and with greater dignity than they do now.
madam president i would like to confirm what the rapporteur mr maccormick has said in relation to the request for the waiver of mr brie s immunity.
i therefore referred to rule <NUM> which seemed wholly appropriate to the situation and asked for the opinion of the legal affairs committee.
we do not want <UNK>.
<NUM> by mrs sörensen on behalf of the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament for further actions in the fight against trafficking in women <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
on this third point we had the opportunity yesterday to debate the proposals with the presidency and in particular the issues which will be on the agenda at feira.
we must find a measure which is appropriate for the reactions and the various situations.
but that is not the case.
my question is this will the commission s work programme include a schedule for this or how do you intend to proceed.
first and foremost we want to increase the eu s capacity to take a strategic political lead on economic and social issues as this is an essential condition for europe to overcome the challenge facing it with regard to the new information and knowledge society.
mr president i would urge colleagues to strengthen this report by insisting on environmental liability.
if the national authorities do their job properly and i am sure that they will we will be able to raise appropriations for specific problems and projects from the middle of <NUM> and in the next few years.
the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has requested that the item on venezuela be replaced by a new point on temelin.
he had been sent by the basque government to defend the basque country in madrid.
mr president thank you for letting me conclude.
surely you can see that.
my group is pleased that the social affairs council gave the goahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that in fact a group of highranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the council an initial report by june <NUM>.
as is also stressed in the report it is particularly worrying that in the area there will be a test of the european union s i quote ability to develop an effective civil and military crisis management strategy aimed at conflict prevention.
i therefore believe that the european union in addition to the military aspects which i would like to place great emphasis on particularly when it comes to peace in this region which is not a million miles away from us should have a clear and unequivocal position.
the president of the european parliament and the president of the commission signed the framework agreement applause.
i would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at european union level.
i believe it is extremely important that when in this context we decide about this report we send out a crystal clear signal about the <UNK> of our judgement on the issue of food safety.
the debate is closed.
the question is do we have an adequate constitution and what kind of constitution do we want.
we do not in fact yet know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as i was going to put this to the house.
this has from the outset been the position of the portuguese presidency.
the sensitivity and complexity of the matter might explain why we are confronted with a total number of <NUM> amendments at second reading.
this is certainly a quite regrettable incident.
not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the <UNK> way to go about as a rich part of the world trying to help them.
given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted i would like to ask the council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with parliament.
lastly i believe and this is also the presidency s intention that we should continue to cooperate actively with the united nations given the skilful intelligent and capable way in which the secretarygeneral and the un organisation in general have conducted these discussions and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties positions.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
with regard to definitions i can partly accept amendments no <NUM> to article <NUM> on the definition of tse suspected animals.
i would like to underline that although the minutes mentioned specifically the epp group it is in fact not the only group to have acted in this way.
this aspect will be included in the initiatives which i propose to present to the council and parliament at the end of this year so that they may be ready in the spring for the european council in order to provide more impetus for liberalisation in the areas i have mentioned.
we are a union with our own legislation which has resulted in our own legal system and with our own interests based on the internal market and monetary union which is why areas with different standards of security within the european union must be a thing of the past.
<NUM> by mr oostlander and others on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats on kosovo.
we must give decisive support to its future.
madam president presidentinoffice of the council gama commissioner barnier ladies and gentlemen firstly on behalf of our group of the european people s party christian democrats and the european democrats i would like to convey my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to giorgos dimitrakopoulos and jo leinen for what we believe is a sound report and it is important that we in the european parliament and i say this most emphatically adopt positions on the key issues facing europe for which there is a broad consensus within the european parliament.
i should also like to respond to the question put earlier.
on the one hand regarding state aid to the environment you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that for the time being this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs.
we will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise.
i am more doubtful however where a number of the other projects are concerned.
it is also a cultural europe.
mr hänsch has just spoken in support of this request.
parliament approved the joint text.
as a member of parliament s committee on agriculture and rural development i should particularly like to highlight the fact that tobacco producers are not opposed to the changes proposed by the commission insofar as these changes are justified on public health grounds.
parliament gave its assent the debate on mrs buitenweg s report will take place at <NUM> pm.
you say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted.
mr president in some language versions the motions are shown as being tabled on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists by mr wiersma and by a certain mr <UNK> who does not however belong to our group.
what has been produced by the commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace.
we should think about the racist and xenophobic statements which have been systematically made by this party.
madam president for those members who do not know i would like to make it clear beforehand that i do not belong to the action group which started this friday action but that i was the acting president who had to contend with it.
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday at <NUM> noon.
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed.
i cannot see that eu origin is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal.
in other words the overriding aim has been to maximise profit in a sector which is already highly profitable and this has led to cuts in investment which have affected the quality of the overall service provided for the majority of users.
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another.
i believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic <UNK> the member states would react positively to the proposal.
it is vital for intellectual property to be protected.
he was successful in that application and i am pleased to say that he was duly appointed.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> am.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
in this context i would like to say that the helsinki council resolutions may well be satisfactory but they are inadequate.
it should however at least contain the promises mr prodi made on behalf of the commission.
if the regulation has been amended to this effect we will back it without hesitation.
there is more to be said on that score.
the committee has always kept a clear priority and has insisted upon it both to the council and to the commission namely to have the <UNK> <UNK> route of traceability on safety grounds that we can get for mince as well as other forms of beef.
however i believe that in the future it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.
secondly even if the commission and the council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.
we must all make sacrifices in order to achieve this goal.
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.
the question of the distribution of the umts frequencies is a matter that should not be regulated at community level.
we are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the member states and the community.
perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the intergovernmental conference so that the european union finally has a true urban policy.
i do not want to <UNK> the rules up.
the euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join.
we have tried to drive this proposal through.
we will examine questions to the council.
in any event i would like to keep this parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> pm and resumed at <NUM> pm.
however i do not consider that this is appropriate.
as i said there is scope for discussing this when we come to examine mr provan s report.
i will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of eastern europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of europe particularly by increasing military budgets.
i feel that it was both the work of the presidency and the commission and the involvement of all the female members of this house who were there and who joined with the national mps of the fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of poland which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work.
parliament in its amendment no <NUM> proposes that we give eur <NUM> million to south africa eur <NUM> million more than the council.
i shall simply pass on these observations to the competent departments and the translation departments in particular so that if appropriate a more detailed revision of the specific terminology and definitions contained in the directive may be carried out.
increasing the european parliament s participation in meda s decisionmaking process is another point that i believe to be crucial.
in addition as the rapporteur points out there are at present millions of thirdcountry nationals residing lawfully in the european union who often find themselves deprived of the right to free movement and residence.
measures need to be implemented which for instance take account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy.
subject chinas accession to the wto in keeping with the commissions opinion on the igc would the commission agree that the accession of china to the wto represents a sufficiently important agreement to justify <UNK> the assent procedure of this parliament.
mr president i would very quickly like to go back to the events which took place during the explanation of votes or during the point of order this morning.
in the college of quaestors we have also discussed because we too are concerned <UNK> that are taking place within parliament.
second we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are implemented and encourage them not only at european union level but also in the aid that we give to third countries in the form of water projects the impact of which lies in a <UNK> ecosystem affecting the countries of the european union but also those that are part of the meda agreements for example which must be taken account of in the map projects and even in others like the upper <UNK> basin or switzerland.
we will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the rules of procedure.
the rapporteur mrs grossetête has produced an extremely balanced report containing a series of accurate observations which deserve special attention.
president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation of the regions of the union which was adopted last year by the commission indicated that the <NUM> richest regions of the european union still had an average gdp per head that was two and a half times higher than that in the <NUM> poorest regions and my fellow members have also reminded us of this.
this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue.
we shall see how much arbitration is required but the french presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the european union s institutions.
this is shameful.
i should like to elaborate on the point which my colleague <UNK> deva mentioned.
this directive stipulates that an additive shall only be admitted if there is sufficient technological need if there is no risk to the health of the consumer and if the consumer is not misled in the process.
mr president firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their magnificent work and all the speakers in today s debate for the additional ideas they have contributed which will no doubt be useful to the commission and the debate in the council of ministers.
i urge colleagues to back the rapporteurs proposal and i urge the commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable.
it is extremely important.
i would be very happy to answer the honourable member if i had any idea at the moment of how the debate on this issue will proceed.
the second proposal i would just like to make is as follows we are discussing the european research area.
secondly growth and convergence with the other countries of the european union may come to a halt in some countries.
it is true that this is not done at national level but perhaps we should begin to move in that direction so that from now on we know what they are doing with their money.
i am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible the committee on employment and social affairs.
joint motion for a resolution on falsification of data concerning mox fuels at sellafield.
mr president we have listened to the statements by the council and the commission and i would like to make the following observations.
and yet most of these rights already exist in the european union as they are present in the treaties in the european convention on human rights in the institutional traditions common to the member states and in the international conventions to which they all subscribe.
the changes to the whole system have made it easier to control.
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.
i now have a brief announcement to make and would be grateful for your attention.
would the commissioner not agree that the most important thing for the european economy in order to provide the social benefits that we would all like to have is for it to be allowed to develop without <UNK> round its neck of excessive social commitments and problems.
there is after all a great deal to be considered.
it will not be possible to watch the bbc in the irish republic.
we have put a lot of time into coming up with a definition of <UNK> because it is difficult from a legal point of view but i think that we have now achieved a compromise with the rapporteur at least i hope we have and the silence on the report on asylumseekers which parliament is going to put to the vote must be seen as parliament supporting the commission s position.
i should like to thank the commissioner for that answer because i share his view that parliament should be involved in the evaluation of problems relating to any execution of the fifth framework programme or any previous programme as well.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
it was in fact raised by the austrian foreign minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers.
el mr president commissioner i should like as we are discussing the action platform on equality decided in beijing in <NUM> to take this opportunity to extol the role played and the efforts made by the un on this issue and to remind the house of the important role played and the contribution made by the union in adopting a common accepted action platform at worldwide level.
before the vote.
admittedly there is no legal basis in the treaty for a common forestry policy.
we began discussing it yesterday in the committee on budgets.
mr president the aim of this proposal for a directive is to limit <UNK> noise without <UNK> grip and therefore <UNK> and braking safety.
the situation is becoming ever more critical but the right to water also has to be seen as a human right.
i do not wish to interfere in the debate but the issue of olaf and napolitano was of course a highly controversial one in the entire house and we are all aware of the problems associated with it.
clearly there is no question mark over any of this and therefore i also consider that it would be appropriate for you to obtain clarification of the issue.
the labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions.
the only question that remains to be answered here relates to the financing of the court of auditor s new building in luxembourg.
mr president commissioner the two reports in question particularly mr valdivielso s report deal with one of europe s problems in great detail.
the committee on budgets has rejected this working method.
i should like to remind the house that <NUM> of mexico s exports go north and only <NUM> come to europe.
that is precisely the stage we are at now.
i believe it is high time for us to take a look at the content side of things because unfortunately europe is still lagging behind a little in this respect.
the end is the creation of an area of prosperity and political stability to the south of the sea that we have shared with north africa and the middle east for all these <UNK> it is about the sharing of values as well as the sharing of trade.
i therefore urge our rapporteur and friend mr galeote quecedo to perhaps incorporate some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is initiated that an appeal is made to the council and that for once our parliament does not fall short of the position of the council and the commission as unfortunately has been the case for the last ten years.
mr president i am sure that we are all aware that piracy and counterfeiting constitute a very serious problem.
this issue has of course been a regular agenda item in contacts with the countries of central and eastern europe which are both transit countries and even the countries of origin for the great majority of this traffic.
having talked about content i would like to say a word or two about form and first of all reply to the comments of your rapporteur on the study on the socioeconomic effects of the cohesion fund ordered by the commission.
the next item is the debate on the report <NUM> by mr marset campos on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on a community action plan for the reconstruction of central america <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
i would now like to say a few words on the events which <UNK> in rotterdam.
however we were very divided when it came to the vote.
i do not have to go any further than my own country to see that in many cases local authorities and so on are actually responsible themselves for environmental damage.
this is not in question.
it is moreover also accepted as an important and effective tool.
it is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the united nations lifted.
at the same time it is a question of being clear about how the institutional questions of enlargement towards the east qualified majority voting and the numbers of commissioners and meps are to be solved.
we are also concerned about china s unwillingness to participate in a dialogue.
it was sent to the commission in november.
the first thing we are able and want to do is to step up dialogue and communication between the two communities on cyprus.
confronted with this situation the inhabitants of brittany the vendée and <UNK> as well as the forestry workers in other regions await a signal from the european union.
i would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard.
let us get to the point.
we cannot be satisfied with such a record.
i would now like to comment on a remark made by mr medina ortega.
this would not be tenable in the long term in view of the various interests that are represented here.
first of all i must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all.
mr president in principle we must welcome the fact that the mediterranean area is again being seen more as a partner of the european union.
parliament adopted the joint resolution.
in summary and by way of conclusion i would like to advocate a <UNK> <UNK>.
she has achieved a great deal.
it must also be made clear that cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.
without any doubt this will then be a service mr president to the european public and by means of the results we produce we will also regain and <UNK> something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.
all this has to be put in place to ensure that we get the best possible results for the work that has been undertaken and for the expense that is incurred.
mr president i would like to thank the presidentinoffice and the commissioner for their words and to add my voice to the many who have expressed their shock and horror at this tragic loss of life discovered in dover.
mr president although i value the work of rapporteur maaten i have to say that i am greatly disturbed by the european parliament s inconsistent line with regard to tobacco.
questions to mr kinnock.
this may be at member state level but it may also be at eu level.
it is however crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner.
i think however that common rules have to be applied to this sector so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the wild west or even the wild east.
i believe that we should seek something acceptable which would be a step forward rather than reach a deadlock.
i believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of rome and all subsequent treaties.
this particular provision deals with improved transparency and as i mentioned in my presentation to you earlier we believe in the commission that in line with general policy the citizens have a right to know the real dangers to which they are exposed and what measures can be taken to protect them.
what i would have liked to see was a commitment on the proposals indicated in my group s motion such as.
i would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again.
parliament rejected the motion for a resolution.
<NUM> by <UNK> kreissldörfler wuori and mckenna on behalf of the vertsale group.
although this is not or not yet on the agenda it is something we are working on.
on this first occasion for the discussion of euafrica relations in this house i must therefore once again strongly protest about this attack on the freedom of expression by the angolan authorities.
mr atkins s report on the european commission proposal on the single european sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price.
we are indeed dealing with a market.
as might have been expected the creation of the internal market has logically considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the union which have shown an increase of <NUM> and <NUM> respectively between <NUM> and <NUM>.
the responsibility for the position taken by the <NUM> member states was freely assumed by these countries.
there is also the question which was referred to by mr salafranca who i am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.
what we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement.
in my judgement this constitutes a guarantee to both sides both from a political and a financial point of view of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.
we will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted and most important of all we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous cap which is <UNK> them and leading them towards economic decline and the <UNK> of the countryside.
an association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the european parliament and the czech parliament.
i suggest that such a declaration is not necessary when voting.
the next item is question time <NUM>.
thank you very much mr radwan.
throughout the whole of this exercise we must take account of the interests of the consumers and the interests of the environment and these are complicated tasks.
the amendment seeks to correct this.
initiative of the <UNK> of luxembourg with a view to the adoption of a council decision establishing a procedure for amending articles <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> and <NUM> of the convention implementing the schengen agreement of <NUM> june <NUM> on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs.
but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order.
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding.
we would like to have these questions answered by the commission.
but that is not for next year.
mr president on a point of order i just want to ask you whether it is customary when the spokesman for a political group fails to turn up for the debate that the spokesman can then be inserted later.
in the meantime there is a great deal of money and mr gollnisch i cannot allow you to say that it will be used in some remote hypothetical time.
mr president some of us have asked the presidentinoffice and commissioner patten specific questions.
to this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.
my fellow commissioner mr chris patten together with the other commissioners responsible for foreign policy set up a review group only at the end of last year which is to undertake a very swift analysis of the tasks performed by the current technical assistance offices and consider which of the tasks should be carried out in a different form in future.
i think this is one of the <UNK> remarks ever made about democracy.
in fact this is now out of step with the spirit of the time and with what we understand by european legislation and must be changed.
this possibility was not mentioned at all in the committee s discussion.
it is the first budget for which the new commission has drawn up a preliminary draft budget and the first budget in which i as a new commissioner shall be involved right from the outset.
however i regret the fact that the amendment that i presented on behalf of the ppe has not been accepted.
finally despite the uncertainty hanging over the future of the peace process in the middle east which we have just debated developing our euromediterranean relations is one of the french presidency s main concerns.
the framework decision aims to ensure that the member states apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.
these tasks should respond to the needs of the european institutions the social partners at all levels the national and regional institutions and business.
in the small amount of time i have for this intervention i must add that i agree with the imbeni report and in particular i would like to highlight the following issues.
however i will just remind you that the meeting in bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.
i agree with mr schulz.
it is indeed the case that aviation is growing rapidly.
amendment no <NUM> is considered acceptable.
the union for a europe of nations group almost agrees with their conclusions but as a result of a very different logical argument.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
with regard to your questions i will say again that the distribution of responsibilities between the commission and the member states dictates that these matters fall to the member states.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the portuguese presidency that with the recent speeches in berlin the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the igc than the first but i would like at this stage to record my thanks to the portuguese presidency for their <UNK> in consulting the parliament both here in the plenary and in the constitutional affairs committee.
this decision is yours to make as this is a very serious issue.
mr president i gather that this question refers to the issue of culture within the wto.
mr president i welcome the two commissioners who are most involved in the development of the budget and i have no doubt that president prodi will be present at the debate that will take place in two months time.
it may simply be a matter of coordination it may be a matter of establishing minimum requirements it may also be a matter at a higher level of harmonisation.
it is used to monitor this serious phenomenon and determine the approach to be taken in a multidimensional policy at national and european level.
in particular we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of <UNK> and <UNK> the island.
by rejecting the rapporteur s amendment no <NUM> the committee on economic and monetary affairs has aligned itself with the council.
however i feel that in order to genuinely fight fraud in the european union we need to change europe s expenditure system.
however it is the case that <NUM> or perhaps a little more of delays are due to problems in the management of air traffic.
report <NUM> by mr brok on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy on the proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the preaccession strategy for cyprus and malta <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
mr president allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur mr ferber for the good work he has done.
we know that this requires a proactive approach and that we can count on your determination.
mr president ladies and gentlemen it is almost midnight already and i do not wish to extend this sitting unnecessarily.
i think that we can and we must look at what is happening in the third world.
and having heard the contributions made today by the honourable members we really can say that the liberalisation of the energy markets has progressed faster and more efficiently than we expected in the last parliamentary term.
the groups have agreed that this is the only way of exerting any influence.
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the environment committee is a very simple one.
after all small and mediumsized companies do not have the means to pay for expensive legal procedures.
i likewise expect the european commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by <NUM>.
mr president the rapporteur mr imbeni has done an excellent job.
parliament adopted the resolution.
the answer cannot be not to speed up developments in the direction of an eeurope.
as far as the second proposal is concerned the ideas of amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> and some parts of <NUM> which contain sensible suggestions can be adopted again formulated appropriately.
i could also give my support to the legal separation of the management of railway infrastructures from the provision of transport services.
it should be pointed out that the european parliament has taken responsibility for altering the very composition of chocolate by allowing the introduction of vegetable oils and fats other than cocoa butter.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.
i am also grateful for the many suggestions put forward for the report compiled by myself and mr dimitrakopoulos.
i would be very grateful to you in particular commissioner if we could achieve this together.
mr president like my colleague mr evans it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective <NUM> funding in particular.
mr president this agreement deals with a sensitive issue cooperation in the field of criminal law.
we were delighted to do so because the european parliament is hereby complying with its task in connection with implementing article <NUM> of the treaty of amsterdam.
this is not the europe to which we belong.
we need to find a way out of this impasse.
if we want to be credible internally we also need to have a sound policy externally.
it should also be noted that the monitoring centre on racism is based in vienna not least thanks to the commitment of the present chancellor and then foreign minister wolfgang schüssel and that we are proud to give a home in vienna to this kind of institution that keeps a <UNK> eye on xenophobia and racism in all the european countries.
in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism the confederal group of the european united left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion mr nogueira román on leader.
as a result he is <UNK> to criticise a confusion which did not exist.
<NUM> by mr salafranca sánchezneyra and mr hernández mollar on behalf of the ppede group to the council and <NUM> to the commission on tunisia.
there are at least two questions which i think must be answered.
the people s representatives have the power to <UNK> anything they have done.
moreover i would say that if there is a great gulf between us it is on the issue of jerusalem.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to followup regulations of this kind.
if we are all in agreement that is what the arrangement will be.
we are all aware of the <UNK> acts of these multinationals which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment.
that is why today s debate has in fact enabled us to embark on the further deepening of the single market for in the single market and the euro we have for the first time the environment we need to get the financial service providers in the eu to operate in a truly efficient manner and to enable us to take account of the idea of financial legislation and financial supervision.
we must never for a moment forget that our greatest task in europe is a <UNK> one.
i sincerely hope that as someone here said this window of opportunity will be opened very wide indeed and that representatives of the council and of the commission will continue to work to this end with the turkish government.
my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process.
this is why we have tabled an amendment of article <NUM> which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic as long as they do not cross the border between two member states.
it is already hard enough to set up a single currency on this basis so how on earth is a constitution going to be achieved.
to clarify our position amendments nos <NUM> and <NUM> can be accepted as the changes they make to the wording avoid any contradiction with other provisions of the regulation.
finally i would like to say that i support the introduction of benchmarking with regard to the development of the information society.
we need to create the basis for a knowledgebased economy and an information society at eu level.
of course the final <UNK> will be made as in any institutional negotiations and i think this is no bad thing at council level especially at the level of the council of heads of state and government who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this.
diplomacy at the beginning of the twentyfirst century has indeed been marked by great events and processes that are giving it much greater scope than it has had in the past.
i would particularly like to ask the presidentinoffice of the council to work together with the other fourteen countries to ensure that the european investment bank is at last in a position to extend credits to croatia.
the challenges faced by the eu are exciting and historic.
recommendation for second reading bowe <NUM>.
such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.
for example in the area of <UNK> <UNK>.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
first from the strategic and political angles it is important for the european union to build up its relationship with a country that is so important in that part of the world and which above all is making progress in terms of respect for the values of human rights.
the vote had already taken place in the legal affairs committee.
madam president great importance has been attached to the reform process which deserves to be acknowledged although this may be somewhat premature.
there are however two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.
this is a task which all meps the council and the commission must take on during this legislature the creation as has been said already of an area of freedom security and justice.
each and every one of us can remember the trial of strength we had to take part in last year with the council because the council wished to complete the funding of the reconstruction of kosovo by drawing particularly on the appropriations for cooperation with the countries of the south.
i would recommend parliament to adopt mr maaten s report without amendments.
the commission s proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings is an important step in achieving the aims the union set itself to protect its citizens from the adverse effects of air pollutants.
the difficulties are once again being allowed to persist to the detriment of the regions concerned.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
i would call for your moderation and i very much respect the correct way as members of this parliament that you have raised this problem in this session and have considered it but it is also necessary to create the conditions so that there can be a window of opportunity.
there are delays in pension payments in all <NUM> of the member states.
and he is right of course.
mr president i am speaking on behalf of mr tajani as a member of the same delegation and the same committee the committee on legal affairs and the internal market.
we have even noted that the council of europe itself is showing more courage than this parliament.
it is important too and we would like to see this mentioned in the text that we are to vote upon tomorrow at a time when we are involved in enlarging the union to include countries for which the respect of fundamental rights is a significant question.
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.
the rapporteur is right there.
the european parliament must be aware that the <UNK> <UNK> which dictates the composition of chocolate internationally stipulates that it is made from cocoa butter.
the attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all member states.
in particular there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.
this represents definite progress in relation to the current situation which may continue until <NUM>.
mr president i would just like to say a few words on the question of the incorporation of the charter into the treaties.
<NUM> by mr sjöstedt and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance on the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites.
mr president on behalf of my group i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that we support the report just as we welcome the positive tone of the commission s communication.
so the report will contain recommendations but the commission does not have instruments at its disposal.
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to <UNK> the serious social differences which exist.
that concludes the debate.
we need to use the knowledge in better ways.
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september.
i shall briefly remind you that life is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the european union and also in third countries whether they be neighbouring countries around the mediterranean countries around the baltic sea or applicant countries.
but we should not establish a system today.
the vote will take place at <NUM> pm.
the commission should react quickly in this respect.
he was due to visit the european parliament today and give us an eye witness account of the situation in chechnya but he was not allowed to leave russia.
although commissioners can of course talk for as long as they wish i would ask them to help me in this regard as well so that we can finish on time.
genocide is being practised against the iraqi people on the pretext of sanctions against the regime of saddam hussein who is still in power on the grounds that he has nuclear weapons which have not been found.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
however there are losers as well as winners in the internal market.
at the next assembly of the icao the united states must commit itself to the adoption of a new and more restrictive standard for aircraft noise as well as to withdrawing its complaints and <UNK> measures.
finally the commission wishes to make it clear that this additional presentation does not encompass its entire programme for years to come in all areas.
it is not clear to me from this draft resolution whether parliament intends to make a decision on whether or not the commission has exceeded its authority.
well we are all aware that the midterm review planned by the berlin summit is due to take place in <NUM>.
europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on.
the other aspect that i would like to highlight concerns the need to standardise the professional qualifications training programmes and working conditions of those working in this sector.
it has not been too controversial so it is also possible to discuss it at the end of such a sitting.
this being the case let me now come to the proposals made in the report.
secondly it has made a commitment to building a europe with a social conscience which provides a practical response to the problems of european citizens and thirdly it has established a new dialogue based on the universal european values that have been asserted and developed over these six months.
it is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why i cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations.
i would especially like to thank the commission and the competent commissioner mrs de palacio for supporting parliament s position.
this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again.
this is the third time i have appeared before you in the six months of our presidency and once again this allows the council to have a direct dialogue with this house.
the commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the european community.
at the beginning of the topical and urgent debate we had a discussion on the application of rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure that is to say adjournment of a debate.
i also think it is essential to incorporate the rights of the child into the charter of fundamental human rights.
as far as proposed amendment no <NUM> is concerned the commission cannot accept the part which refers to the second paragraph of article <NUM> in which mention is made of administrative and staffing costs incurred by the commission in administering this scheme.
the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities is demanding that the member states provide women who give evidence with protection and refugee status.
you have our support in matters of transparency and when it comes to the momentum created at tampere which we want to keep going and you have our support because there is a possibility of bringing pressure to bear on the council.
mr president as a new member of the european parliament and as a permanent member of the conciliation committee for the first time i have to say that i was satisfied with this procedure which saw representatives of the main institutions of the european union making every effort to achieve a happy medium that is to say between the possible and the feasible bearing in mind existing conditions and possibilities which are of course not the same for all europe s ports.
ladies and gentlemen i would like to start the debate.
we need a completely different system.
i hope that when faced with these realities parliament will support the commission proposal.
indeed the <UNK> s <UNK> is revealed by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised.
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the european union is approved by common agreement between the council and this parliament.
we do not wish to be part of that.
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach.
the resolution adopted by the european parliament in november <NUM> was also a step in this direction in that it referred to the cancellation of the foreign debt of the countries in the region which amounted to usd <NUM> billion.
i think that mrs lienemann s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the council.
the french presidency is also determined to make progress on the matter of intensified cooperation which was added to the igc agenda at the feira european council.
i would therefore like to call on the presidency of parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the presidency itself to invite the members to do likewise.
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur for her invaluable work.
mr president the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the member states work together to protect groundwater drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing eu environmental legislation.
the motion should also send out nothing more and nothing less than a clear signal of parliament s support to the president of the commission who unfortunately is not with us here today.
madam president with regard to this amendment there is a linguistic problem.
in this respect we must be able to ensure that those who do commit themselves to renewables have a fair return on their investments.
bearing this in mind i can agree to accept amendment nos <NUM> and <NUM> with a minor change to the latter.
judging by the great political sensitivity which you have always shown i am sure that you will understand that message.
that is a very big step forward.
there are of course other interests which need to be taken into consideration.
da mr president i completely support the council s statement to the effect that the geneva conventions have been a very important stage in the development of humanitarian legislation.
i am pleased that mr amado talked about the edf.
it is not a case of one or the other we need both.
i could also mention children s rights which are a huge problem including in a number of candidate states.
what immediate action does the commission intend to take in order to expedite such an agreement.
i am currently awaiting this report.
i would like to thank all those who spoke with such <UNK> of purpose.
this is a complete revolution of the commission s way of working it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.
in this respect the <UNK> <UNK> organisation of the european territory must be retained and in a way improved.
i would moreover like to make the comment with regard to the amendments tabled for article <NUM> that information visits are not being ruled out.
for this reason i would draw attention to an extremely positive point of the resolution which calls upon the community to monitor the economic and social development of the populations of the areas in question because that is where we will achieve most.
it is important both in terms of the functioning of the single market and most importantly for the protection of consumers.
my group regards that as a breach of our rules of procedure and i would ask you mr president to examine this matter.
the next item is the report <NUM> by mr maat on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ec no <NUM> on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products com <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
that is what i wanted to say mr president with a few personal observations of course on the reasoning behind the commission s position as i explained it just now.
the commission is able to approve the principles behind amendments <NUM> and <NUM>.
mr president it seems simple.
breaches of community law pertaining to international agreements fall within the scope of the annual report.
as to member states leaving the commission to do the dirty work i hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement.
mr president i would like to begin by warmly congratulating the european commission and especially commissioner vitorino on its extremely constructive legislative proposal on the issue of family reunification.
that has been done.
the european union often raises human rights issues in the context of its political dialogue with the united states and the council takes note of the case raised by the honourable member.
there must be a precise timetable which is respected for the recognition of associations and independent political groups such as the <UNK> the national council for liberties in tunisia the <UNK> and the democratic forum respect for union freedom for the integrity of the judicial system and the reform of the press code.
however the administrative status of the resident is not the same as the political status of the citizen.
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia.
the citizens of the union represented by parliament increasingly want to be involved in this area which concerns them and affects them directly namely the common security and defence policy.
mr president i too should like to congratulate the commissioner and the presidentinoffice of the council for their solid recommendations and above all for their proposals.
this is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries which accounts for <NUM> of the total work force there compared with <NUM> in the eu.
i think it is time for some changes.
indeed as regards agriculture we believe that it is vital to set up a fund to tackle the enormous problems in the primary sector.
mrs gonzález álvarez as you know i am well aware of all these problems.
this will offer an opportunity to give new impetus to the barcelona process by means of adopting a peace and stability charter and by strengthening economic and cultural links between the two shores of the sea we share.
i would however point out that it is possible to prove the effectiveness of the structural funds since divergences between states have been reduced.
today knowing that this issue is to be discussed at the feira summit we would like to ask you about the intentions of the council and the commission and also to share our views and hopes with you.
the united states now acknowledges the existence of the echelon system.
for this reason mr presidentinoffice of the council we must work closely together over the next few days in order to guarantee and secure the necessary secrecy of certain documents.
we believe that it is a magnificent initiative on a european level to dedicate a special year to languages in europe to knowledge of them and to the recognition throughout the whole of the european union of the importance of languages as a <UNK> of cultural and historical wealth and an expression of the very identity of the societies which make up the union.
as for the content of this communication we basically intend to tackle the following issues.
question no <NUM> by <NUM>.
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.
we are concerned by the <UNK> of the building of relations with syria as well as mr barak s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the israeli army and the sharm <UNK> agreements.
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament the council or the commission.
firstly on the question of the parliament discharge.
finally i would like to express my satisfaction that the member states of the eu are so resolutely and actively supporting this austrian proposal and not just taking refuge in <UNK> and clichés.
there is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding angola.
this is to be regretted.
mr president i would just like to make the house and the presidency aware as i believe it will be of interest to them that yesterday on the occasion of the conference of reconciliation in vienna an agreement was reached between the austrian government representative mr <UNK> and the american deputy finance minister <UNK> <UNK> on compensation payments for the victims of nazi forced labour in austria.
from the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud these <UNK> are no more than fresh grounds for sterile conflicts.
i do not think so.
commissioner nielson will recall that a couple of months ago i suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes.
by its very nature the stability pact in eastern europe is <UNK> on the pretext that human rights and democracy are being protected.
however the question stressed the fact that this is a problem which has recently become more serious precisely because of the ease with which our borders can be crossed.
finally of course the cyprus question has a role in the discussions with turkey.
i do not want to point the finger at any particular country but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the united kingdom.
we are right to criticise human rights violations and discrimination in candidate countries such as turkey or some of the eastern european countries when it comes to the roma and other minorities but that is precisely why we must set an example when it comes to human rights in the european union.
that is something at least.
mrs redondo i have to tell you that mr cunha has just come in.
i regret the delay in providing the honourable member with the information requested.
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence lack of information is one.
the spanish journalist <UNK> <UNK> is a symbol of all those victims madam president and i would like to ask you on behalf of the european parliament to convey to him our feeling of solidarity because this solidarity expresses the unquestionable defence of freedom of expression that we as democrats are obliged to make.
the documents are available and we are available to discuss them.
madam president as my colleague chris patten has clearly said it is my responsibility to set out the commission s position on the other two reports being discussed this afternoon.
the second question is as follows to what extent will this directive have to be amended.
the commission report generally <UNK> this observation particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest by which i mean the french overseas departments and more generally the most remote regions.
accordingly my group will vote against any part of the resolution in which such a judgement has been passed.
once again the figures speak for themselves as a result of the reduction in working hours there has been an increase in growth and jobs in the french economy.
let me emphasise that another reason why we are able to adopt it unamended is because the council exceptionally i am tempted to say has incorporated many of the european parliament s amendments at first reading.
i do believe that mr blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
<NUM> by schori sakellariou and veltroni on behalf of the pse group.
mr president having carefully examined all the amendments i can tell you that the commission can accept amendments nos <NUM> <NUM> sections <NUM> and <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> section <NUM> and <NUM>.
there has been a whole decade of dictatorship in that country.
it was not the commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two member states germany and finland by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which member states share with the commission on such issues.
allow me to close by stressing once again that we can use our vote in parliament tomorrow to give a signal.
the next item is the joint debate on the.
one thing shocked me in the speech of the presidentinoffice of the council.
we find ourselves in a situation where we are competing in political terms with the dictator milosevic and we must convince the people that the european union is willing to provide assistance.
the basic rule must be that people have the right to enter the eu freely not the opposite.
it proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market.
hence we would emphasise that whilst we welcome greece s participation in the <UNK> since <NUM> may <NUM> and its achievements the criteria must be applied in full to all candidate countries.
it guarantees that the restrictions for travellers will disappear once and for all by the end of the year <NUM> as i have already mentioned.
i think this proposal is a good one.
when i say we will take the necessary steps i include the possibility of removing rina from the list of companies <UNK> by the commission.
at the same time an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.
mr president the first common regulations in the fisheries sector were adopted as early as <NUM>.
the provision on redeemability which was proposed by this parliament at the first reading a first reading which took place almost a year ago and was accepted by the council is clear.
finally the council has considered the commission initiative on combating exclusion.
however i must again congratulate our rapporteur mr gallagher.
furthermore the member states must carry out a periodic assessment.
pursuant to rule <NUM> of the rules of procedure i have referred this dossier to the committee on legal affairs and the internal market with the request that they attend to it as quickly as possible.
i fully endorse the statements by the presidentinoffice and commissioner patten.
we are facing a major problem posed by the lack of adequate port facilities for <UNK> deliveries not least because of the <UNK> of the <UNK> ports at <UNK> and <UNK> which means that only <UNK> and to a lesser extent <UNK> can be used.
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction.
that is why we would welcome mr <UNK> being given the opportunity this week to clarify his remarks here before the european parliament and if necessary also to amend them.
i did find it to be rather limited on the basis of a desk study but in view of the considerable interest in europe there is every reason to continue the regulation.
although i am well aware that we have a duty to give consumers all the relevant information regarding the risks presented by the products they use i do not feel that it is our duty to adopt <UNK> laws particularly where third countries are concerned.
this is an area where some member states are <UNK> in protectionism at the expense of others.
to make this possible we need to reform ourselves in the intergovernmental conference and no progress has been made here at all so far.
the next item is the oral question <NUM> by mr varela suanzescarpegna on behalf of the committee on fisheries to the commission on the shipwreck of the erika.
we will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.
firstly there are still member states that have not signed the convention on the protection of the financial interests of the eu.
in the recent proposal to the european parliament and to the council adopted on <NUM> march the commission introduced the same safeguard clause concerning feedingstuffs produced within the european union.
we feel that the key factor underlying the council of ministers action is the attempt to contribute to the success of the peace process through our presence and our action.
the amendments approved by the committee on the environment substantially improve the councils common position.
the resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women s representation and that all political parties must take action.
there is no doubt that these treaties update the regulations in this field but neither is there any doubt that there are currently many problems which they do not resolve.
it is of course important for competition between airports not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment.
we must point out however that even if the actual appropriations available for leader were increased the community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the <UNK> nature of the cap that will be implemented in the context of agenda <NUM> and the wto.
certain facts which have become clear in the last few days some of which have been the subject of <UNK> political debate in recent weeks show that in actual fact much of the confusion and fear that has been expressed and many of the objections raised are wellfounded.
madam president the issue of the decommissioning of nuclear waste is a very serious one.
<NUM> by mr vinci and mrs <UNK> on behalf of the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left on the journalist andrey babitsky.
finally it is true that enlargement of the european union and the growth in the number of official languages will have certain implications as amendment no <NUM> suggests.
in spite of all these reservations i think we have an extremely good program before us to enable us to strengthen the european film industry.
thank you commissioner.
if we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion.
the issue of women as asylum seekers might also have been reflected upon because we need to look at the tampere decision in its entirety with a view to improving the asylum process.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> pm.
the citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future.
as everyone who has already spoken has said it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected.
i know that the commission is endeavouring to take account in the budget of the priorities it has accepted namely creating a knowledgebased society and improving the quality of life of our citizens.
the vote will take place tomorrow at <NUM> noon.
parliament adopted the decision.
i the council common position with a view to adopting the european parliament and council directive amending directive <NUM> on the licensing of railway undertakings <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>.
the minutes were approved.
the vote will take place on thursday at <NUM> am.
in my opinion setting the priorities like this is the best way of starting the debate on a budgetary year.
mr president ladies and gentlemen although the euro has been around for a while now it is still an abstract concept.
the criticism of the court of auditors was justified.
i think the argument is completely unacceptable.
there have been some very embarrassing discrepancies between the possibilities open to the european missions and those of the united states for example.
ladies and gentlemen i invite you to observe a minute s silence.
madam president i am grateful for the fact that as i said to you in my letter last week in circumstances such as these you are diligent enough to defend democratic principles rejecting acts of terrorism on behalf of parliament and expressing your support for the spanish government in the fight against this terrorism.
this will be a very important body and i believe that it will also be very important to secure everyone s cooperation in encouraging an effective fight against racism and xenophobia in the european union.
amendment no <NUM> is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of article <NUM> are concerned because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of article <NUM> especially when the ucits are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses as discussed in the council.
the programme draws on the lessons learned from the experience of the preceding programmes but although the council and the commission are well aware of the present situation they are still afraid to take the plunge.
mr president a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.
we consider that it is absolutely imperative that in urgent cases we can act rapidly.
in short we need to create a new institutional and social framework which reflects the changes which have taken place and which <UNK> the problems and contradictions which arise from the new contract with the two sexes.
the letter which you have read reflects the personal motives which the chairperson and perhaps other meps put forward but which does not reflect the point of view of the legal affairs committee.
what we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader community no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens.
on a final note i would like to say a word of thanks to finland and germany who are to be commended for initiating the proposal.
so far fewer than half of the member states have ratified the protocol on protecting the union s financial interests.
in principle the commission does not object to these requests but i would remind you once again that these requests do not belong in the preamble to the directive especially since they are completely unrelated to the content of the directive.
this was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning.
madam president with your permission i should like to use this brief opportunity at the end of this debate to respond to something which was raised in a point of order at the start of this sitting.
but what is the value of such a measure.
mr president i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report.
but not in this case.
i would like to know how the commission intends to deal with this.
i wonder since mr da costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the chamber whether mr kinnock could confirm that the commission supports the view explicitly stated by mr da costa today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government.
so if you have a problem.
madam president it is clearly true that there have been developments this weekend but it is too soon to tell what they will amount to.
in my opinion this is indeed a huge challenge which must be accepted.
we believe that it is a very good report and it makes a very positive contribution to an issue of fundamental importance in the process of introducing the euro into the lives of our citizens.
it is very important that we include liability in that process.
but it was still a good outcome.
the first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions.
i have done that many times in many places.
mr president the commission proposal which is now under discussion is to be seen against the background of the new architecture resulting from the entry into force of the amsterdam treaty.
it is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the danish people s consent.
as far as amendment no <NUM> is concerned which has been adopted and which seeks to keep refugees within the scope of the draft directive but to exclude from this directive on the right to family reunification people who benefit from temporary protection or subsidiary protection i maintain the position that i expressed before this house during the debate.
commissioner it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the commission.
we are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion especially in the sparsely populated rural areas one of which has been particularly strongly and <UNK> represented in the debate this morning.
the other amendments not directly related to our proposal are mainly based on the evaluation report on the emcdda and they are said to lead to a detailed review of the basic regulation.
mr president ladies and gentlemen this is the first explanation of vote which i have given in many years and my first explanation of vote as chairman of the epped group.
you need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly.
what are we to think of the rejection voted by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market.
the commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place.
fourthly i support mr sterckx in his analysis when he talks about mutual distrust between the united states and the european union.
mr president the transeuropean networks are often <UNK> as one of the key successes of european integration.
mr andersson to answer your question i should like to start by confirming that a coordinated approach at european level to the information technology and telecommunications sectors is essential for the future development of the european union.
mr president i want to conclude with two respective observations.
i feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will there is a way.
or does it intend to.
we clearly have different views one of which is that we believe the development of the european economy can be regarded with confidence.
one of the most controversial points that arose during the debate was the contradiction between the anticipated proliferation of members of the european parliament because of enlargement and the ceiling of <NUM> members the treaty of amsterdam has imposed on our parliament.
mr president with regard to fishing i am not going to go into the details of the commission s legislative proposals.
the second point of contention relates to copyright and we shall vote against the amendments tabled by the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats.
its total value is eur <NUM> billion.
i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.
it has always been our opinion that every effort should be made to achieve this objective as we have always felt that it would be a good opportunity to launch a genuine partnership that would be of mutual benefit to both continents.
mrs malmströms report sets out some of the stark realities of the violence which is perpetrated against women in many forms and at all levels of society.
in return i promise that i shall raise the matter at the conference of presidents.
for this reason alone it is important for the council to follow the european parliaments lead and not to take refuge in the conciliation procedure which may allow it to gain time but not recognition.
it is the result first and foremost of the <UNK> and exploitation of immigrant labour.
i knew right at the beginning of the debate that there was a reason why i was so pleased to see you here in the house.
the commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and clearly to monitor all the issues relating to its application which is the responsibility of the national authorities.
the tampere conclusions make a clear call for the commission to submit a report on the implementation of the conclusions of the high level working group on asylum and immigration for the consideration of the european council in december <NUM>.
we expect you to be consistent as regards the promised changes to the disciplinary procedures and the reorganisation of internal financial control.
i would like to finish off with the following thought.
mr president commissioner mr presidentinoffice of the council in my view the question which needs to be raised in geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.
they do not bind the council and they do not affect the free and normal functioning of the community institutions in which austria is still participating in full.
mr president in response to this question i would first of all like to point out and i am dealing with the second part of the question first that it is a huge undertaking to persuade the seven thousand companies which i mentioned a moment ago to switch to the <UNK> the international accounting standards.
in the middle of the second paragraph of the english version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings but no reference to legal consultants as there is in the german text.
the directive will therefore provide a benchmark for the levels of ozone in ambient air.
this is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a <UNK> incoherent <UNK> of european countries and their <NUM> thousand or so diplomats compared to the <NUM> <NUM> diplomats of the united states.
the practical operation of the system will be improved.
evil needs to be <UNK> in the bud and it is not enough that there are governments to do so.
this is still under discussion but although it looked initially as if the two proposals might be combined in such a way as to satisfy the requirements of the house as a whole it now seems that the other request for a temporary committee of inquiry does not in any way agree with the proposal from <NUM> members of parliament.
there is an initial point which needs to be cleared up it is true that the free movement of goods and products within community countries seriously <UNK> the creation of the single market.
in the interests of transparency and information to members we need to know the extent of the problem of <UNK>.
let us not forget this even in our political considerations and decisions.
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union and especially within the framework of the council.
what we are talking about here is the amalgamation and updating of three existing directives two of which have already been assessed by the court where the legal basis was not commented on.
the budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced.
i just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to macedonia and the effectiveness of eu financial and other support.
the european commission responded to this need by publishing a green paper on radio spectrum policy for public consultation at the end of <NUM>.
mr president ladies and gentlemen i welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and i should like to start by saying that i consider this to all intents and purposes to be the first reading of the lalumière report because mrs lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project.
the text would finally provide the basis for the european commission to take decisions on funding and acting on behalf of the european union to then sign financial agreements with these various bodies.
sv mr president thank you very much mr sjöstedt for this question.
indeed these areas and it is right to stress this have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the union.
the eu is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states.
i therefore voted against paragraph <NUM> of the resolution which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.
motion for a resolution <NUM> by mrs jackson on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on structural fund programmes in the member states and national implementation of eu environmental laws.
that is the decision we have taken today.
the national and regional funding plans will be adopted annually on the basis of indicative programmes.
this brings us to the desire and agreement that the edf even if it is just in terms of figures will at least be absorbed into the <NUM> budget so that we in parliament can actually see where the money is being spent.
for this reason with this amendment which i think should be taken into consideration we accept the overall proposal from the commission and i hope that the commission will in turn accept our amendment.
food safety with regard to <UNK> is also of prime importance.
i will conclude with my third question.
mr president i have already received many reactions from within the sme world to the text that we will be adopting tomorrow and partly on behalf of all these smes i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work.
i believe that the citizens expect this of us and that the treaty of amsterdam allows us to shorten and speed up these processes.
however if i were asked to give my opinion on the overall status of the situation in europe i would have to say that i am somewhat confused and concerned.
obviously the parliament s role is different to that of the commission.
i supported amendment no <NUM> on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of <NUM>.
da the danish and swedish social democrats have today voted in favour of the report by mr andrew <UNK> duff and mr <UNK> voggenhuber regarding drawing up a european union charter of fundamental rights.
i also feel that the reference to the countries of central and eastern europe is essential as i think that every proposal ought to take account of the prospect of enlargement.
it is a prerequisite for <UNK> people to make the necessary efforts efforts which are needed to adapt to the new situation.
i would be grateful if this error could be corrected.
we have to demand the highest standards of ourselves.
we have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.
i called for the issue to be debated during the last partsession and i wonder at the fact that a month passed before our socialist friends managed to reach a consensus with us regarding a motion even though there should not have been any difficulties as we agree on the basic points.
if we are to progress in a serious and socially just way it is very important that we take the step of dealing with all these incomes jointly and furthermore i believe that this is a good first step in relation to the process of globalisation.
it is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.
could you please refer this question to the conference of presidents so that some system can be found to deal with very urgent and important matters such as this one.
the timetable that the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy is proposing is not too pressing.
we need these instruments so as to be able to meet our financial commitments under the terms of the development strategy for malta and cyprus.
regrettably the union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now.
i would be keen to hear the council s and commission s opinion on this.
for this reason i would appeal to you to support mr chichester s amendment no <NUM> which states that if the eu does not abolish import quotas it will at least indicate its intention to start official wto talks on the future distribution of import quotas.
this morning the president of parliament mrs nicole fontaine repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.
i would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.
i consider that this is a serious <UNK> and that in principle it does not <UNK> our legal system.
mr president commissioner directorgeneral i would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von wogau report i welcome the commission s openminded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules and to propose practical reform measures.
a substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the commission.
for that reason because we believe that we have to continue working for the european union and we do not believe that the best approach is to take shortcuts with regard to such a serious issue for that reason we have abstained.
above all they are the logical continuation of a policy of european unification which the republic of austria has been pursuing in an exemplary manner for decades.
i shall take note of your comments.
i can also tell you that the council believes that there is no way that a satisfactory start can be made to the process this year.
i therefore suggest that the court of justice reconsider the way this procedure works.
if there is one thing all those involved should be clear about where the <UNK> grant of discharge is concerned then it is this we are not talking about a certificate of <UNK> here.
i very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.
in january last year the council adopted the specific programmes for the fifth framework programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries.
what i can say is that i hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.
we need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia.
to this end the resolution calls for the european union to have sole responsibility for planning execution and monitoring of the aid.
we also know from past experience that in principle the commission is very much in favour of taking this step.
i was therefore very pleased with the commission s document for the lisbon summit with its two main messages.
the <NUM> therefore recognise the importance of credits both for exports and for the environment and the importance of the work currently being done within the oecd on this subject.
mr swoboda the vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
the relevant committee will continue the discussion of this issue.
mr president i come from the same country and the same region as the rapporteur mr andersson.
as such commercial interests are taking precedence over the protection of fundamental rights.
having said this i will look at the situation objectively.
yet this is not the situation.
if we are then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved.
this is now being brought into question by the commission something i find hard to understand.
i thank mrs palacio the committee s chairperson and the committee members for their efforts.
i believe we must prevent this from happening.
the commissions proposal is also completely insufficient for this.
i will ask our rapporteur to express an opinion if he wishes.
we are also pleased with the solution which we finally reached regarding discrimination on the basis of religion which should not be a covert reason for discriminating on the basis of ethnic origin.
in my view more attention should be paid to the media which is such a determining factor in social life.
i should also like to stress the interest which commissioner busquin has taken in our work <UNK> mediterranean cooperation in the field of research particularly at the forthcoming informal summit on <UNK> on <NUM> september.
lastly i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the <UNK> position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam.
what is clear and what unites most people in this chamber who want such a charter is that it must be in the treaties.
i would also like to emphasise that it is not up to the european parliament to deny tobacco products which are legally available on the market a fair chance of commercialisation.
this was in response to debates in parliament last year which led to the amendment of the directive to include primary agricultural products.
regarding the council and commission statements on the echelon system the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs has requested that the vote on a joint motion for a resolution at the close of the debate be postponed until the april partsession in strasbourg in order to enable the groups to assess the information given to them in the course of the debate.
mr president i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan <UNK> which <UNK> peace and happiness.
the economic and social damage which we have spoken about today in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions.
i see that the french council presidency is extremely well disposed in this matter and so we should work on it over the next few days.
it is however perfectly correct that when it comes for example to chemicals we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.
once again the council is of the opinion that the successful conclusion of the conference on the creation of an international criminal court would be a significant historical achievement in terms of making the world a safer and more just place.
the sitting was suspended at <NUM> am and resumed at <NUM> am.
in the agreements with the northern countries they are completely <UNK> and there is no way that the fleets with the greatest interest in fishing there can do so.
the most important objective of the summit must be achieved as quickly as possible and that is to improve the competitiveness of the european economy.
we believe that it is absolutely essential in order to ensure that it is the democracy of the people and not the power of money which prevails in the union that the commission should exercise its power of initiative responsibly at the moment.
mr president as someone who is deeply dismayed by the ongoing <UNK> condemnation of austria by fourteen member states i am particularly pleased that the initiative for the report in question has come from austria.
eur <NUM> million are estimated to be required for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a new building.
to use a sporting metaphor the representatives of the council and the commission have been doing what i call the <UNK> <UNK>.
i actually think that i have not made too bad a job of it.
furthermore the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.
i believe that the work which is being carried out in edinburgh is not permitted by national law in some other member states.
let me start by making a positive comment.
our first priority was to work on creating the right conditions to make the european union the world s most dynamic and competitive economic area based on knowledge within the next ten years.
it could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality.
i know a guarantee has been given that the removal of this sum from the budget will not affect any of the financial obligations entered into by the commission within the framework of the cap but i just do not believe it.
madam president i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group francis wurtz reminded us of just now.
an inventory will be made of the consultation procedure in this communication and an action plan will also be presented.
mr president i am pleased that you knew i was here and that i was going to speak.
fr mr jarzembowski feels that the european union should do the impossible in order to complete the internal market in the railway sector by <NUM> with a view to giving railway undertakings a chance to regain part of the road transport market.
i share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation.
europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of europe and not simply for the development of an individual state whichever one it may be.
secondly this report is in favour of using open standards and the common interface to secure access for all citizens to the information society and to enable them to participate in it from a technological point of view.
